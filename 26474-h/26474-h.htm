<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A book</span> containing accounts of the work continually
and unceasingly being carried on by the
gallant officers and men of the Royal Navy
should prove of considerable interest to all, and,
at the present time, especially to the American
reader. I am glad that a New York journalist
has had the opportunity of witnessing a part of
the titanic task of our courageous sea-fighters, and
of personally gaining an idea of the hardships
endured by the plucky men who are watching
our coast. This little book may help considerably
to enlighten the general public on the work
of the branches of the Navy, and prove that the
men engaged in this tedious, hazardous, and
nerve-racking vigil are going about it with the
same old valour befitting the traditions of the
Royal Navy. They have fought the savage
beasts like true sportsmen. They have rescued
enemy sailors, clothed and fed them, without a
sign of animus, knowing that victory will crown
their efforts to throttle the enemy of humanity
and of civilisation. And that enemy is now the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
common foe of the United States as well as of
England. He has been the sly enemy of the
United States even before the declaration of
hostilities by the American Congress, while he
was the avowed enemy of other countries engaged
in this terrible war.</p>

<p>These stories, light though they be, give a
conception of what it is to search the seas in a
submarine, and the bravery of the youngest
branch of the Navy&mdash;the Royal Naval Air
Service&mdash;is palpable even from the modest accounts
given by these seaplane pilots. They have
confidence in their supremacy over the enemy,
and are all smiles even in the face of imminent
danger. It shows that often British coolness and
pluck have saved a machine as well as the lives
of men.</p>

<p>Of special interest is the talk with the captain
of a mine-sweeper while he is on the bridge of
his vessel. He tells of the many neutral lives
that have been saved by English seamen at the
risk of their own vessels and the lives of their
crews. Noteworthy is it that Great Britain in
the course of this war has not been the cause of
the loss of a single neutral life. Mines have been
placed at random by Germany's pirate craft.</p>

<p>The grit of the English seaman comes to light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
in the author's journey in a naval ambulance
train, as does also the fact that the service takes
the utmost care of its wounded and sick. In the
account of the Royal Naval Division it is touching
to note that the men who are fighting in
France and who distinguished themselves so valiantly
in the Ancre and other battles, still cling
to sea terms or talk.</p>

<p>The accounts in this volume may cause the
people of my native country to appreciate the
necessity for silence on the part of the British
Admiralty, as now that their ships are linked
with ours in the effort to defeat a common enemy
the same idea of giving no information to the
enemy even at the cost of criticism undoubtedly
will be included in orders. Nevertheless, while
playing the trump of silence, it is encouraging to
read stories of the Navy so that the readers have
certain knowledge that silence and brief reports
do not mean that nothing is being accomplished.
We have recently had an instance of the efficiency
and courage of the officers and men in the
fight between two British destroyers and half a
dozen of the enemy craft, in which the Germans
lost two vessels and the British none. Commanders
and others greatly distinguished themselves
in this conflict, which occurred in the dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
of a moonless night. And the deeds of the
Royal Navy are certain to be emulated by the
officers and men of the United States Navy, for
blood will tell.</p>

<h1>SOME NAVAL YARNS</h1>

<h2>I. THE LOG OF A NAVAL AIRMAN</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Men</span> of the British services are exasperatingly
modest. You are forced to wring stories of experiences
from them, and when you are thrilled
to the core over their yarns they coolly inform
you that their names must not appear. Fortunately,
there is something about a story which
"rings true." From one of the soundest pilots
of the Royal Naval Air Service I heard his experience
of the previous day. We will call him
"Q," as he happens to be known in the station. It
is his middle initial. He is a tall, well-built man
of thirty, who knows a seaplane backwards, and
it has been woe to the enemy when he met him.</p>

<p>"We started at dawn," he began. "There's
not much flying in the dark, only occasionally.
First, we ran the machine out of the hangar, and,
as usual, tried the engines. In the fading darkness
or growing light it is a great sight to see the
flames flashing from the exhaust. In the beginning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
you run your engines slowly. Yesterday
one of them kicked a bit. The cause for the
hitch was discovered, and they were once more
started. Remember that it is expedient that the
engines be thoroughly tested before a flight, as
you may spend anxious hours if something goes
wrong. The spluttering ended, and we ran them
up to full speed. This done, we waited for more
light before hauling the machine down to the
water. Once the seaplane was water-born, we
taxied ourselves across the port at moderate
speed. As we rose in the air we had to be careful
of the masts of the ships in the harbour, especially
as it was foggy. We then opened up the
engines, and the seaplane rose. It was very thick,
so we kept 300 feet above the water, flying on a
course. There were two pilots and an observer
in the machine. Our next work was to estimate
the velocity of the wind. This is always rather
difficult, and, at the same time, it is most important
to have an accurate estimate of the wind.
We steered ahead, hoping to see a mark which
would guide the observer in his course; but because
of the fog, we were not able to pick up our
mark. Hence we had to go on and hope for the
best.</p>

<p>"We flew higher, about 1,500 feet, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
clouds were about 800 feet, so we were far above
them. For two and a half hours we steered
straight ahead on the lonely fog-covered sea.
We were to meet some warships which expected
us. But even after covering all that distance, we
saw nothing at all, and therefore resolved to descend
and see what prospects there were of 'landing'
and saving our engines. The sea always
appears calm to the man flying above it; and
even when we were 30 feet only above the water
we could not tell whether or no it would be dangerous
to the machine to 'land.'</p>

<p>"By that time we were naturally anxious, as
we thought that in steering straight ahead, as we
had done, we ought to have reached the ships
with which we had the rendezvous. So far as
we could, with the roar of the wind and the propeller,
we held a consultation&mdash;nothing verbose&mdash;in
mid-air to determine what would be the best
move. We decided to alter our course so as to be
sure of getting in sight of land. Half an hour
later we saw the first sign of life since we had
been out&mdash;an old tramp steamship. Ten minutes
after we sighted land. When you are flying at
sea the land, especially when it is low-lying,
takes you by surprise; it suddenly looms up when
you least expect it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"We then picked up a mark and set off on our
course for the rendezvous. So dense was the
mist that we could not see more than one and a
half miles ahead. However, we raced along at
70 knots on our new course, and in twenty minutes
came in sight of the flotilla of warships
spread out below in fan-like form, but all moving
fast. These ships, you see, keep on the move;
but they stay for the time being near the point
selected for the meeting. Instructions were signalled
to us, and we came up, and flew nearer
and nearer the water.</p>

<p>"'Can we land?' was our first question. 'Land'
is always used by a seaplane pilot even if there
is no land within a hundred miles of him. Our
aerial had been thrown out. It was too rough to
go on the water&mdash;or, at least, not worth risking
damage to the seaplane. We carried on our conversation
partly by shouting and partly by signals,
which were quickly understood. From the
ships we received further instructions, and sped
on to carry them out. We had no further difficulties,
and reached home just before sunset."</p>

<p>As an illustration of modern warfare, and the
fact that single British flyers are feared even
by two of the enemy's planes, here is a story told
by a young Englishman, who knows no nerves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
when he is in the air, no matter how near he
comes to being snuffed out by the shrapnel and
bullets. He is a man of 5 feet 10 inches, with
clear blue eyes and blond hair&mdash;one of those
truth-loving Britishers who prefers to err against
himself in his reports rather than tell of an uncertainty
as a certainty.</p>

<p>"'Saw and attacked a German submarine,
which dived before we could close in on her,'"
read this man from a log-book. He turned the
pages, and a little afterwards came on this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Sighted German patrol, and exchanged fire.
Got over Zeebrugge&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"That reminds me," he said, looking up from
the little book which held the notes of so many
exciting events. "They sent me out then when
I ought to have been off duty."</p>

<p>He smiled, as did his hearers.</p>

<p>"Well, I got over the Mohl," he added.
"That's the German pier at Zeebrugge. The
Mohl showed up black, and the water looked
lighter in the darkness. I was up about 2,500
feet, and dropped bombs on the seaplane base.
I mean, of course, the German air base. Only
a few moments, and they showed that they were
ready for me, as the heavens around were lighted
up with searchlights. I dropped a few more of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
my 'eggs,' and could not be certain of what damage
I accomplished, although I saw flames spurt
up from several places. Then the enemy sent
up two long rows of rockets, making an avenue
of light so that I could have read by it. These
infernal things parachute when they get to a certain
height and, with the fire hanging from them,
stay stationary, leaving but one exit. If I had
run the machine into the rockets it would have
been ablaze in no time. These fireworks stay in
the air for about two minutes, which is a devil of
a long time when you are up there. Thanks to
this lighted avenue, I showed up more distinctly
than I would have done in the daytime. The
end of the avenue, I knew, was the target of their
anti-aircraft gunnery. I flew out, and shrapnel
tore all around me. My machine was struck several
times, and, as bad luck would have it, the
patent point of my magneto fell out just when I
got to the spot where shrapnel was thickest.</p>

<p>"My chances of getting home then seemed
pretty slim&mdash;engines out of order, lit up by fireworks,
up 2,500 feet, and a target clear as a pikestaff
for the gunnery. However, I managed to
slide in the direction of the ship on the French
coast. It seems easy to keep out of the way of the
guns; but, of course, they have a demoralising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
effect on a man in the air. Not so much at dark
as in the day, though. Well, I got home all
right.</p>

<p>"Only a day or so afterwards I dropped a
bomb on or near a German U-boat, and I can't
say to this day whether I struck or damaged her.</p>

<p>"'Very lonely,'" murmured the pilot, reading
from his log. "'Just saw a torpedo boat.' On the
next day, let's see.... Oh, yes.... 'Saw two
German destroyers, and raced back to our ship,
and British ships sped after the Germans.'</p>

<p>"A day or so later I had run in with two
German machines. It chanced that there was a
wind blowing about 30 knots, and I was merely
out scouting, and did not carry a gun. The two
enemy ships were joined by a third, and then
they gained sufficient courage to come a bit close.
They shot away my aileron control, and we were
in a very bad way. For twenty minutes we were
continually under fire, and below there was a
heavy swell. It really was only through knowing
how scared is the enemy flyer when you go
for him that I am here to-night. I let the enemy
planes get nearer and nearer to me, and by the
time they were ready for firing I dived at one of
them. This so upset the poise of the three machines
that they turned tail and swung around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to come at me. They made huge circles to get on
my flanks again. All this took time, and during
it I was getting nearer and nearer my base. Now
and again the enemy machines were like too
many cooks and the broth; they nearly crashed
into each other. This also upset their nerves.
Incidentally, when you are in the air, only the
other machine appears to be moving, and you
seem perfectly still. My escape is due in part
to the arrival of one of our fighting seaplanes.
A German is desperately afraid of them, unless
there are four Germans to one Britisher. When
they saw this fighting Britisher coming they did
not take long to get away. They knew who the
flyer was, too, for a man's style in the air is always
characteristic. They had heard of this
flyer before. So they turned tail, and I got back
with a machine out of order. 'The Prussian
code of politeness,' we call it when they retire
with two or three machines against one of ours.
It is the respect that they show for our fighting
seaplanes. Of course, this does not detract from
the confidence we have in our superiority."</p>

<p>I heard also that seaplanes have been called
upon to serve at all sorts of tasks on the dismal
briny. On one occasion a senior naval officer of
an English port received word that neutrals were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
out in boats, and that they had no water or food.
Their steamship had been torpedoed, and their
last message by wireless had been caught by the
British. The naval officer despatched a seaplane
with bread and water, and the pilot delivered it,
with other trifling necessities.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful sights that meets the
eye of a seaplane pilot is when he comes on the
scouting parties of British warships. They are
never at a standstill, and to keep moving and in
the same place they all make a wonderful circle
at full speed, with one vessel in the centre. That
ship is to receive the message or whatever is
brought by the seaplane, which in the event of
calm weather lands on the water and sometimes
sends off one of her officers to talk to those
aboard the vessel protected by the ring of speeding
grey warcraft.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<h2>II. OVER THE NORTH SEA IN A SEAPLANE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> have an accurate conception of some of the
experiences of a seaplane pilot of the Royal
Naval Air Service, I took advantage of an opportunity
to go aloft over the North Sea.</p>

<p>"Come with me, and we'll get you togged out
for the ride," said the gunnery lieutenant. He
was a Canadian, who had lived many years in
Rochester, N. Y., and it was he who remembered
that I would need something warmer than the
clothes I wore.</p>

<p>In the room to which he conducted me were
many different styles of air garb. He picked
down a hat and coat of black leather, observing
that they would serve the purpose.</p>

<p>The morning sun shed a yellowish glow on the
dancing sea, and the wind was blowing at the
rate of 32 knots. It was agreed by all that there
would be an excellent view from the aircraft as
the day was clear. By the time the gunnery lieutenant
and I reached the ways on which the great
seaplane rested, men in overalls, begrimed with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
oil and dirt, were testing the engine. As the
great propeller spun round, coats ballooned out
with the rush of air, and the noise was such that
one could hardly hear one's own efforts to shout.
It was a sound which filled you with awe. The
propeller was stopped after a few minutes, and
the mechanicians shot up the sides of the craft,
and punched oil and gasolene into the places
where it was needed. Young officers in naval
uniforms stood around the machine&mdash;all are usually
interested in a departing seaplane. Not far
from us were many immense sheds in which were
some of the newest types of England's youngest
branch of the Navy. There were aircraft there
which bespoke the inventive genius of the
Briton, and the confidence of the young pilots
inspired you with pleasure&mdash;it was a confidence
that they could beat the enemy at one to two.</p>

<p>Presently the chief mechanician announced to
the pilot that all was well, and the man who was
to take me above the North Sea, attired in his uniform
and a thick white woollen scarf, climbed
up the seaplane's port side. He signalled to
me to follow, showing the places for me to put
my feet. The climb was more difficult than I
had imagined, and a literal <i>faux pas</i> might not
have aided the flying ability of the machine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no lashing the passenger to a seat
in the plane. The place in which I sat would
not have cramped three men, the pilot being in
front. There was a loose leather seat cover atop
a wooden box as the only sign of comfort.</p>

<p>"Make the best of it," said the pilot. With
that, he turned on a switch, and the propeller
whirred a warning of departure to the clouds.
It was a parting shot to ascertain that the engines
were in trim, and after the engine had been
stopped the craft was wheeled out into the waters
of the bay, and then again the propeller rent
the air with a burring noise which is surprising
even if you are more or less prepared for it.</p>

<p>For the first few seconds we apparently swung
along on the water's surface, then skimmed
along, the floats at the sides of the plane bobbing
on the slightly crested sea. It was only a matter of
less than a minute before I realised that we were
rising in the air between sky and water, and with
amazing speed we soared, and soon were 300 feet
in the air. Still our aircraft climbed and
climbed. The ocean, which had been beating on
the sands now outside, seemed peaceful and
green. The town which I thought had such winding
streets when I walked through them now
looked as if it had been laid out by a landscape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
architect. Up, up we travelled, and the higher we
were the more deceptive was the North Sea.</p>

<p>Through, or, at least, far above, the opening
to the port the pilot steered the seaplane, and
far down in the sea I saw a strip of dusky something
pushing a white speck before it. The pilot
signalled for me to look down. It was then
that I realised that this funny little thing was
a British submarine going out to sea. The pilot
bellowed something; but I could only see that
he was shouting, no sound coming to me above
the din of the propeller. We steered straight
out to sea, and miles away I saw a grey speck&mdash;a
warship prowling over the lonely depths.</p>

<p>After listening to stories of pilots who have
been tossed on the bosom of the waters for twenty
and thirty hours, the thought of the hardships
these pilots have to undergo came vividly
to me. I thought of how I might feel if a dozen
anti-aircraft guns made us their target. Behind
us the town now had almost disappeared. The
officer kept the nose of his machine towards
France, and I thought, as we sped on, of the
young officer who had an appointment for dinner
with his fianc&eacute;e, and who had descended in
the wrong territory only a week before. These
daring pilots, however, think nothing of cutting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
through the air from England to France and taking
a bomb or so with them for Zeebrugge on the
way.</p>

<p>I began to think a great deal of my pilot. He
was about twenty-seven years old, and was cool
and certain. He was a dare-devil, and had only
been over in England a short time after spending
months on the coast near the front.</p>

<p>The town had disappeared, and it was evident
that we were practically at the mercy of the
compass. I felt no dizziness at the great height.
In fact, I had no conception of the altitude of
the seaplane then. Perhaps I was comforted by
the whirring of the propeller, the thundering
rumble of which was increased by the stiff wind.
I looked headlong down, and experienced no
sensation of fear. I seemed to be in a solid moving
thing as stable as a machine on earth or water.
We must have been up 4,000 feet and possibly
100 miles out at sea. There was a sameness
about the travelling. You heard the roaring
blades, and saw the deceitful sea and clouds
on a line with you here and there. The pilot
turned the plane, and soon we were headed for
land. We kept at the same altitude, and after a
while beheld the shore line. The marvellous
speed of the aircraft appealed to me then, as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was not long before we were over the harbour
gates. At the same time, the seaplane just then
did not seem to be making any headway. From
a height of 4,000 feet the great vessels looked
like fair-sized matches. How impossible it
seemed to aim straight enough ever to hit one
of those narrow things. As we turned around
above the town in the direction of the hangars
the trembling wings appeared to waver a bit
more than usual. I looked down at the town,
and we appeared at a standstill. You can tell
sometimes when persons are looking at the planes
by a speck of white, which is a face. The earth
and sea rose nearer, for, as one does not appreciate,
the plane was descending.</p>

<p>Our seaplane swung around and around like
a bird about to settle, and, as the seagulls do,
alighted on the waters against the wind. With
remarkable skill and patience the pilot carefully
steered the machine until she faced the ways on
which waited a throng of air-station officers and
waders. Soon we were properly placed, and a
dozen men clad in waterproof clothes splashed
forward into the water, and caught the floats of
the seaplane's wings. As the engine had been
stopped before we landed, I got the first chance
to speak to my pilot. He told me to get on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
back of one of the waders, and in a few minutes
I was again on dry land. Then the first thing
I thought of was how the machine looked in the
air. The officers congratulated my pilot on a
remarkably fine landing.</p>

<p>We had been more than two hours and ten
minutes in the air, and we were both glad of a
good stretch as we walked to the hangar, the
burring buzz of the propeller still in my ears.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<h2>III. ADVENTURES IN A SEAPLANE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was an interesting gathering which faced the
warm fire in a smoking-room of an East Coast
station of the Royal Naval Air Service. Many
of the seaplane pilots who were attired in the
blue and gold of naval officers had recently returned
from successful endeavours in their hazardous
life in the North Sea and on the Belgian
Coast. And here they were in old England chatting
about their experiences without brag or
boast&mdash;just telling modestly what had happened.</p>

<p>On one side of the spacious room, on a long,
deep leather-cushioned sofa, were an officer of
the guards who was known to have an income
of at least ten thousand dollars a year, and who
had taken to flying for the excitement; a stocky
youth of twenty from Salt Lake City, Utah, who
was known to have eked out a livelihood on fifty
cents a day at Dayton, O., so that he could pay
for his training as a pilot; another youngster,
scion of a wealthy Argentine family with English
connections; and an Englishman, just over
thirty, who had been born in California and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
heard the 1914 call of the mother country. They
were cramped, but comfortable.</p>

<p>In other chairs of the deep, comfy English variety
were a rancher from Canada; an Olympic
champion, whose name has often figured in big
type in New York's evening newspapers; a lieutenant-commander
of the Royal Navy, who had
hunted big game in three continents; a wind-seared
first mate of a British tramp; a tanned tea-planter
from Ceylon; a 'Varsity man from Cambridge,
whose aim had been a curacy in the
English Church; a newspaper man from Rochester,
N. Y.; a London broker; the head of a
London print and lithographing business, looked
upon as one of the best pilots in the service; and
a publisher, who in pre-war days had been more
interested in "best sellers" than in seaplanes.</p>

<p>All were dreadnoughts who looked upon it as
a privilege to give their lives to smash Prussian
militarism. If you had asked any one of them
for an interview he would have scoffed at the
idea. But ordinary newspapermen cannot be
blamed for being enthralled at the share of these
pilots in the World War. What's printed about
them? Just a paragraph to the effect that "Several
seaplanes last night bombed Zeebrugge or
Cuxhaven." They dashed out into the frigid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
North Sea with an errand, but their share in
the fights and the valuable assistance they have
been to Great Britain as scouts are seldom mentioned.
Still, they "carry on," asking for no encouragement.
And right here it must be explained
that "carry on" means to do or die
in this war. It is the byword of the British of
the day.</p>

<p>It chanced that "Tidy," as we will call him,
was the first speaker who had something to say.
He had a reason for talking, for some evil genius
had followed him for two days. The yarn is best
told in his own words, so far as they can be
remembered.</p>

<p>"It was my patrol and I started from France
at half-past five o'clock in the morning," began
the seaplane pilot. "I shot out to sea for about
thirty miles, and then continued to run along
the coast for about 63 miles. I caught sight of
a Dutch ship, and a little while afterwards observed
a submarine. Almost as soon as I saw the
vessel there was a cloud of smoke. I raced to the
scene, knowing then that the Dutch tramp had
been torpedoed by a German U-boat. Four
miles further on I espied a second submarine. I
opened fire on the first submarine, which then
I saw had taken in tow a boat evidently containing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the survivors of the Dutch vessel. I observed
one of the Dutch sailors crawl to the
bows of the boat attached to the submarine and
cut the rope. At that instant I dropped a bomb,
which fell about 25 or 30 feet from the submarine.
The under-sea craft went down very
quickly, and I descended further and dropped
my aerial, and the mechanician-operator sent
out a message. I threw other bombs when I
thought I detected about where the submarine
was in the sea. It was like a hawk after a fish.
The other submarine fled without giving me a
chance.</p>

<p>"I continued scouting, having warned the
British warships that two submarines were in the
vicinity. It came over very misty, and in the
deep haze I saw three or four German vessels
coming out. As I turned, deciding to race home
and give the word, my engines failed me. I
went down and down, holding off from the white
caps of the sea for two and one-quarter hours.
My next adventure was the sight of some German
aeroplanes. After fiddling around, I got
my engine started, and flew up to 1,000 feet
above the sea. It was lucky that I started the
engine when I did, for the sea was becoming
unpleasant. But then my magneto failed me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and I realised what was in store on those wind-torn
waters. I was forced to dodge about like a
bird with a broken wing. The wind freshened
to 40 knots. Although we did our utmost to keep
the seaplane off the water, it, of course, had to
rest there, and I became horribly seasick. The
mechanician and I tried to keep the craft afloat.
We fired off our rockets, hoping to attract the attention
of a friendly or neutral vessel, but at the
same time realising that we might fall victims
to the enemy.</p>

<p>"All night the mechanician and I were tossed
on the sea without a chance of attracting anyone,
as our rockets had given out. The cold was
unbearable, and both of us were very seasick.</p>

<p>"Dawn came, and there did not even then
seem much more chance of our being rescued
than at night time. You could not imagine anything
lonelier than a seaplane on the bosom of
the North Sea when you are without food or
drink. The rocking of the light craft would
have made a good sailor keel over with seasickness.
The happy moment, however, did come.
We were spotted by a mine-sweeper, and she
raced to the rescue. Our mangled machine was
hoisted on the kite crane of the little vessel. We
had been thirty-six hours without food and water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and most of the time bumped about on the
sea.</p>

<p>"That would seem to be about enough for the
evil genius to perform, eh? But we were
doomed to have another surprise in store. I
went to bed in a room in a little hotel, and had
hardly closed my eyes when there was a great
explosion; the whole place seemed about to fall
down. I put on an overcoat, and tore outside to
discover that those blamed destroyers which I
had seen earlier were bombarding the place
where I went to sleep. A lucky shot demolished
the building next to the one in which I was in
bed; then I went back to bed, too tired to care
what else happened."</p>

<h2>IV. SWEEPING THE SEAS FOR MINES</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are days when a mine-sweeper captain,
who is continually running the gauntlet of death,
reckons that he has been fortunate. Usually
this is when he just escapes being blown to bits
with his vessel or sees what can happen to a
steamship when it strikes one of the enemy mines
planted at random in the North Sea. There
are days when he goes out and sees nothing
worth while. However, despite the great danger,
unseen and unheard until all is over, these
mine-sweeper men guide their vessels out daybreak
after daybreak, with the same old carefree
air, to perform their allotted task in this
war.</p>

<p>Many of these men were fishermen, who
looked as if they had slipped out of funny stories
in their thick jerseys and sou'-westers; now
they are part and parcel of the British Navy,
proud of the blue uniform and brass buttons and&mdash;when
they have them&mdash;of the wavy gold bands
on their sleeves. There are others who were officers
and so forth in the mercantile marine in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
pre-war days. They have sailed the seas from
John o' Groats to Tokio: and to them New York
is merely a jaunt.</p>

<p>One of the latter, who was a passenger-vessel
officer, attracted a deal of attention at an East
English port by his indefatigable labour and
fearlessness in his risky job, until he was rewarded
for more than two years of grinning at
death by the Distinguished Service Cross.</p>

<p>He knows Broadway well, can tell you where
he likes best to get his hair cut, and where he
considers they put up the best cocktail. One
day I was permitted to take a trip with this captain-lieutenant&mdash;and
get back. Mine-sweeping
has been written about by persons from Kipling
down, so I will just tell you the story as I then
saw it.</p>

<p>The skipper stood on the bridge of his dusky-coloured
vessel as she soused through the waters
of the grim North Sea, his keen eyes ever on the
alert fore and aft, and occasionally on the sister
ship to his, coupled along with the "broom."
They were "carrying on," as usual. This skipper
was a man just in his thirties. His face was
cheery and round, and body was muscular and
thick-set. In spite of the watch he and his first
mate kept on this particular occasion, he found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
time to give me his opinion on certain things
interesting to the men who go down to the sea in
ships, and also an idea of what it means to be in
command of a mine-sweeper.</p>

<p>"You should have been with us on Sunday,"
he said, as he lighted his cigarette between his
cupped hands. "It was more interesting than
usual&mdash;had something of this damn thrill you
talk about ashore and don't know what it is until
you've been at the firing front or in one of
these blessed ocean brooms. That chap across
the way found a mine in his kite, and we had to
cut the hawser in double-quick time, and get far
enough away from it before we pegged a bullet
in one of the horns."</p>

<p>The skipper explained that none of the mines
are exploded less than 200 yards from the vessels.
He said that the experience he had just related
would have sufficed for a day, but that an hour
later, when he was still brushing up a part of the
North Sea, not far from the coast, he received
a warning from a trawler that a mine exposed
at low water was just ahead of him. Not in his
time had he seen a steamer go astern quicker.
Afterwards, they deftly fished around for the
mine, snapped its mooring rope, and brought it
to the surface. When the mine was at a safe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
distance from all vessels, a couple of men then
aimed their rifles at it until there was a loud explosion
which sent sand-coloured water 35 feet
and more into the air.</p>

<p>But the affairs of that Sunday were not yet
complete. Twenty minutes after the mine had
been exploded a great rumble was heard way out
at sea, and soon it was ascertained by the captain
of the mine-sweeper that a Scandinavian tramp
had met her doom by striking a German mine.</p>

<p>"We went off to see if we could pick up some
of the poor chaps," observed the skipper.
"Among the twenty-one men and boys we rescued
were four who'd been passengers aboard a
passenger vessel which had been torpedoed by a
German U-boat without warning near Malta.
They told us, when they got down into our engine-room,
that they were just having one hell of
a time getting home. I don't blame them for
thinking that. Through good fortune, and taking
chances of being sent to the bottom ourselves,
we have saved the lives of many of these
neutrals who might have perished. Yes, here we
are mine-sweeping as a job, flying the white ensign
of the British Navy; and yet we have found
time to save life imperilled by the enemy.
Sometimes I wonder what sly Fritz would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to say if he'd even saved a single neutral. He'd
be blowing yet. Did you ever stop to think that
our Government never has jeopardised a single
neutral life? On the other hand, the lives of
neutrals that have been rescued at this port run
into the thousands. They talk about the freedom
of the seas. What else has there been until
Germany showed that what she wants is the
'tyranny of the seas.' Leastways, that's how it
strikes me. Ever stop to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His attention was caught by a signal from the
other vessel, and a keen-eyed sailor wig-wagged
back an answer. It was all right, although at
first I still remembered the timely warning regarding
the slightly submerged mine. As a
matter of fact, it was merely a desire of the sister
ship's captain to turn around and "sweep
back," as the land-lubber might term it.</p>

<p>"Let's see," said the commander, "where was
I.... Oh, yes.... Realise that we go out
and save lives that the enemy imperils far out
at sea? They are lives that don't concern us, but
we don't feel like letting a poor chap drown if
we can help it. On the other hand, our enemy
stops at nothing, and, moreover, takes advantage
of our humanity. I think that it should be
known that we dash out to the rescue never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
knowing when the ship may go up against one
of Fritz's eggs, which may be anywhere in the
sea. Why do we go? Just to pick up a benighted
lot from an ill-fated tramp, and there's
nothing in it. Yet we do it all the time, and the
C.O. commends us for it, too."</p>

<p>We came to a new spot in the green sea to
sweep. It was fairly rough, and the little vessel
bumped and jumped. And this is the work that
goes on from daybreak to dusk seven days a
week. If a trawler strikes a mine she usually
counts on saying good-bye to herself and 80
per cent. of her crew, and the other type of
mine-sweeper is lucky if she gets off with a loss
of less than 40 per cent.</p>

<p>Back and forth in a monotonous sea we
steamed, and you had an idea how dull this work
can be sometimes; also that when it comes to
sweeping you saw that the North Sea is a big
place.</p>

<p>"It's become a science," observed the skipper.
"Fritz has a hard time many a night 'laying his
eggs,' and the many ways we have of bringing
them to the surface has baffled him a good
deal."</p>

<p>A torpedo-boat destroyer hove within signalling
distance. The commander was handed a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
message by a sailor. The alert skipper read it,
and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell 'em 'yes.'... Just want to know if we
had swept around there."</p>

<p>Still the smoke-coloured little vessels kept up
the job of plying back and forth in the waters.
Men were busy at the stern of the ships watching
the wooden kites that are made so as to catch the
mines by the hawser that is slung between the
two steamers. The slightest sign of a ball-like
piece of steel in the sea and the dullness of
sweeping is relieved, for then the skipper knows
that he has unhooked one of the mines. Along
came a submarine, flying the white ensign of the
Royal Navy. The mine-sweepers realise that
these men have no arm-chair job, and admire the
commander and crew of the under-water boats
accordingly. A sailor semaphored with his
arms, and the commander of the mine-sweeper
sent a message back, and the submarine passed
slowly on her way.</p>

<p>"If some of those people at home and abroad
at their firesides realised what the men at sea
have to suffer to keep this coast free they might
have a different way of talking," declared the
commander, now taking to his much-burned old
pipe. "Those chaps that have just come in have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
had a week without any sleep&mdash;or next to none&mdash;and
their food has all been canned stuff. There
are many persons who think the North Sea's a
pond&mdash;same as they do over in America."</p>

<p>On we steamed in our section of the waters
with never a sign of a German mine. Finally,
the day came to a close, and the captain ordered
the hawser to be slipped and the kite hoisted in
the stern crane of his vessel, the like being done
by the other sweeper.</p>

<p>As if glad that the day's work was over, the
small craft pressed forward to the harbour, and
were disappointed to find that a big tramp was
taking up the room of their berths. They anchored
outside, waiting for the big steamer to
get away.</p>

<p>"Do they tell you when you can come alongside
the dock?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No need to," said the captain with a smile.
"You'll see."</p>

<p>We had been in the open harbour for about
twenty minutes when the bows of the ugly vessel
came slowly on. An instant later all the small
craft were ready to speed to their respective
berths in their turns, and it was not so very
long before the mine-sweeper was tied to her
part of the dock. The commander of the sister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
vessel to the one I had been aboard came over
to us.</p>

<p>"Good ship that of yours?" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes," muttered the man with two rings of
the Royal Naval Reserve on his sleeve. "She's
all right; but I love this ship. I had her a year
ago, and she's a little wonder. It would take
me a long while to love another vessel."</p>

<p>My skipper laughed.</p>

<p>"Just one of those days," he said. "Come, let's
go and have a spot."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<h2>V. THE ROYAL NAVAL DIVISION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffeted</span> about from Antwerp to Gallipoli,
Egypt, the Greek Islands, Salonika, and then
to France, first under an admiral, then part of
an army corps, again under an admiral, and
finally back to military regime&mdash;the life of the
Royal Naval Division, which startled an Empire
by their valour on the Ancre, has been one
full of thrills, sorrows, threats of extinction,
brave deeds, and perilous journeys. They are
proud of their naval origin, and are also tenacious
of their naval customs, despite the fact that
all their fighting has been done ashore and few
sailors survive among them.</p>

<p>In August, 1914, Mr. Winston Churchill,
then First Lord of the Admiralty, mobilised and
organised, as a division for land fighting, reservist
seamen, stokers and marines, and naval volunteers
whose services were not required afloat,
also recruits drawn mainly from among the
miners of the North of England and Scotland.
Guards' officers, naval and marine instructors&mdash;each
in his own ritual&mdash;help to train them. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the Navy, who raided them when it needed seamen
or stokers for its ships, they were "dry-land
sailors." To the Army, they were just a bunch
of "so-called salts" or "Winston's Own." But
their instructors soon recognised that in these
grousing, middle-aged stokers, and in these silent
stolid illiterate miners and ironworkers
from the North Country, they had the raw material
of soldiers as fine as Great Britain can
breed.</p>

<p>In many respects, the Division has had the
worst of both worlds. They have beaten their
way steadily to the fore without much recognition
in print; but since Beaucourt fell, both military
and naval men have been eager to grasp
their hands.</p>

<p>Now and again a brief mention fell to their lot
while they were in Gallipoli, where the military
were attracted to them a bit by the idea of calling
their battalions after famous admirals such as
Nelson, Drake, Hood, Collingwood, Anson,
Howe, Benbow, and Hawke. Sir Ian Hamilton
made mention of the fearlessness of the division
in his despatches, and Major-General D'Amade
eulogised them for their bravery after the frays
of the 6th, 7th, and 8th of May, 1915. In June,
1915, the Collingwood battalion was wiped out;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of the officers of this battalion and of the Hood,
who went to the attack, not one returned unwounded.
The other battalions also suffered
terribly, having been equally contemptful of
danger.</p>

<p>Prior to that they had, of course, been to
Antwerp. Even if they did not have a chance
to do much, the Division, at any rate, caused the
Belgians to hold out for five days longer than
they might otherwise have done.</p>

<p>Among the many brave men on the officers'
roll are well-known Britishers who have given
their lives for their country. There was Rupert
Brooke, the poet; Denis Browne, formerly
musical critic of <i>The Times</i>; F. S. Kelly, holder
of the Diamond Sculls record, who also was an
exceptionally clever composer and pianist; and
Arthur Waldene St. Clair Tisdall, a great
scholar and poet of Cambridge. He was
awarded the Victoria Cross for his valour on the
25th of April, at Gallipoli, for going to the rescue
of wounded men on the beach. To accomplish
this, he pushed a boat in front of him. On
his second trip he was obliged to ask for help.
In all, he made five trips in the face of great
danger. He met death in action barely three
weeks afterwards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Lieutenant-Commander Arthur M. Asquith,
son of the former British Premier, is one of the
gallant men attached to the Hood battalion. He
has been through the thick of many fights, and
has been wounded more than once, escaping
death through sheer good fortune.</p>

<p>And one of the men whom all England was
wild about is a New Zealander from Wellington,
twenty-seven years old, now an acting lieutenant-colonel,
who was described by an eye-witness
of the Ancre fighting as "a flying figure in
bandages plunging over Germans to Beaucourt."
He is B. C. Freyberg, a born soldier and great
athlete.</p>

<p>Before the Great War, this marvel of courage
was fighting for Pancho Villa in Mexico; and
the instant the European conflict started, Freyberg
realised that he might do better in Europe.
He therefore deserted Villa, and set out afoot
for San Francisco. His splendid constitution
stood him in good stead, and he arrived there as
fit as a fiddle, soon afterwards winning enough
money in a swimming race to take him to London.
In the English capital he received a commission
as a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval
Division, and his promotion has been rapid.</p>

<p>Colonel Freyberg was caught in a live electric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
wire in Antwerp; but it was of so high a voltage
that he was not killed, sustaining only an injury
to his hand and arm. He was even fired at by
his own men, who believed that he was a German
crawling through the wire. Just before the
landing in Gallipoli, on the 25th of April, 1915,
it was proposed to throw dust in the eyes of the
Turks by landing a platoon at a point on the
coast of the Gulf of Saros, where no serious
landing was contemplated. To save the sacrifice
of a platoon, Freyberg, who was at that time
a company-commander in the Hood battalion,
pressed to be allowed to achieve the same object
single-handed. His wish was granted; and
on the night of the 24th-25th of April, oiled and
naked, he swam ashore, towing a canvas canoe
containing flares and a revolver. He reconnoitred
the enemy's trenches, and, under the covering
fire of a destroyer, lit his flares at intervals
along the beach. He had some difficulty in finding
his boat again. A mysterious fin accompanied
him during part of the swim. He at first
took it to be that of a shark, but found later
it belonged to a harmless porpoise. After some
two hours in the water, he was picked up, and
for this gallant and successful feat he was made
a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
In Gallipoli he was wounded in May,
again in July, 1915, and he was mentioned in
Sir Charles Monro's despatches in connection
with the successful evacuation of the 9th of January,
1916.</p>

<p>Hence, this sailor-soldier in a comparatively
short time attracted a good deal of attention
among the naval and military authorities; so it
was not surprising that when he applied for a
permanent commission in the British Army he
was given a captaincy in the Queen's Royal
West Surrey Regiment. The same day, however,
he received this news he was seconded to
the Royal Naval Division with the temporary
rank of lieutenant-colonel. So he retained command
of his old battalion&mdash;the Hood.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the first despatches concerning
the storming of Beaucourt referred to Lieutenant-Colonel
Freyberg as "a naval colonel," all
Britain was wondering who this hero could be.
Some of his friends were not long in guessing;
but it was not until the next day that Freyberg
in name received credit for the remarkable exploit
on the north bank of the Ancre. In the
first messages of the British success it was set
forth that in a battle where every man fought
nobly for the honour of his regiment and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
country, one individual act of leadership stood
out with peculiar distinctness.</p>

<p>A witness of the battle told of the troops on
Freyberg's left being held up, and that between
him and them ran, roughly parallel with the
line of advance, a spur which cut off the effect of
the enemy's machine guns. After fourteen hours
of fighting, bit by bit, the sea-dog soldiers had
plunged through a mile of trenches and ground
sorely marked by shells. Three machine guns
then were pushed forward well beyond that line,
and the still unsatisfied sailor-colonel, his shoulder
and right arm swathed in bandages, asked
leave to go ahead and attack the village. His
men were about 1,000 yards in front of the companies
on his left, endeavouring to advance
across the northwesterly slope. It was more like
a matter of defence than attack. The men were
few in numbers, and had fought like tigers for
long hours without a rest. However, about 500
men were collected, and the dark of night was
spent in organisation. Then, in the misty dawn,
some soldier battalions came up to reinforce the
left, and onward plunged Freyberg.</p>

<p>Out on the Ancre they say that he got so far
ahead of his men that he rubbed his hand over
his head and murmured: "Huh&mdash;I believe I forgot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to tell them to follow me." Whether or not
this is true, only Freyberg knows. But we do
not remain in doubt as to what he and his men
did right afterwards. They ploughed their way
through mud and Germans, with the fire of five
machine guns peppering them. They stuck
right on the heels of the barrage fire, and in less
than twenty minutes from that time the Germans
had been driven from their stronghold of
Beaucourt. Here and there a German post held,
and men in the trenches faced the British bombs
and cold steel. Still the Teutons soon learned
that it was impossible to stop that alarming Briton
and his men.</p>

<p>Freyberg formed a semicircular trench
around the far side of the new possession, and
then they took time to see what had happened
to the gallant little band. Freyberg had received
his fourth wound, and his brave 500 had
dwindled to a number a good deal smaller. The
Britishers, somehow, had been unkind in their
speed to the Germans, and the enemy was left
gaping with wonder at the result of what they at
first took to be nothing more than a bit of bluff.</p>

<p>For this remarkable display of valour Freyberg
received the Victoria Cross.</p>

<p>Reverting to the division itself, it should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
said that every officer of these jolly-jack-tar soldiers
has panegyrics galore to cast in the direction
of General Sir Archibald Paris, K.C.B.,
who was in command of the division at Antwerp
and the Dardanelles. He lost a leg before the
Ancre fighting, and thus was disappointed of
being with them for their great success in
France. He was succeeded by Major-General
Cameron Shute, C.B. What the division has recently
accomplished and the way it has terrorised
the enemy, like Kipling's "Tyneside Tail
Twisters," is a happy thought to General Shute.
In one battalion it is estimated that 90 per cent.
of the casualties in the Ancre fighting were
caused by the closeness with which the sailors
clung to the barrage fire. Their grit caused the
enemy to pale.</p>

<p>They are pleased and proud of their sea terms,
and would not give them up for anything&mdash;not
even if the soldiers of the King do not fathom
their meaning.</p>

<p>It is a case of going to the "galley," while the
red-coat that was persists in the "kitchen." The
first field dressing-station is nothing but "sick
bay" to the R.N.D. man. They "go adrift"
when they are missing from parade, and they ask
to "go ashore" when they want leave.</p>

<h2>VI. A NAVAL SCHOOL</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> one of several institutions, every six
months Britain turns out 2,200 boys who have
mastered the elementary rudiments of seamanship
and are ready to take their places as ordinary
seamen aboard warships. They will not
tell you how many of these schools there are in
Great Britain alone, but you may learn that no
undue activity has been brought about in these
places because John Bull is at war. After having
waded through the curriculum of these boys,
one comes to the conclusion that they are not so
far from being able seamen by the time they
emerge from this place on the East Coast.</p>

<p>It is especially striking how speedily the
youthful mind snatches up the mysteries of signalling
and of wireless telegraphy; and one is
filled with interest in following the boys from
the time they first enter the school to the day
they leave.</p>

<p>In a room where they are "kitting up" are
twenty or thirty boys who have just arrived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
And, as they say in America, there is "no monkey
business" about the instructors: either the
boys are those who are wanted or they are not.
The youngsters receive their first seafaring garb
in a large, well-ventilated room. They have been
in the bath, and their hair is as close as the clippers
can make it. One of them said he was the
son of a lawyer; another that his father was in
the Royal Navy; a third came of a parson's family;
a husky young chap had been a blacksmith's
assistant; and another had coo-ed milk in London
streets.</p>

<p>"An'," declared a petty officer, "they all comes
here believin' they'll be able to get a pot shot at
the Kaiser. Seems to me that they imagine that
William is always standing on guard on the
rocks of Heligoland, just waiting for them to
come along&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>In another section of the school the boys are
grounded in discipline by a petty officer, and by
the time they get through with him they are
accustomed to saluting. Follows then a whirl of
wonders to them. There is a model of the forepart
of a ship, which they can steer, and so learn
port from starboard; there is the ingenious manner
of dropping a lifeboat into the lap of the
sea; and then the interesting work of tying knots,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in which the petty officer instructor takes considerable
pride.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting rooms of sub-schools
is the one where the youthful "salts" are
initiated into the mysteries of signalling, where,
besides the numerous flags for sea conversation,
there is a dummy wireless station, by which they
can become proficient operators. They have
models of ships, so that they can tell which are
British and which are German. Then there are
gunnery schools, and it speaks well for the young
Briton that 90 per cent. of the pupils have such
keen minds that they yearn to learn more of the
mysteries of the study of sea fighting; they have
the ambition to be really good seamen, engine-room
men, wireless operators, or signalmen.</p>

<p>On a section of the school grounds there is a
mast on which is hoisted the White Ensign of the
British Navy. This spot is known as the quarter-deck,
and every time one of the youngsters
passes where he can see that mast he salutes reverently.
Beyond that there is the recreation
ground, where every Saturday afternoon in winter
there are half a dozen games of football.
The officers help them to enjoy that, too, for,
like Americans, they delight in exercise.</p>

<p>It is remarkable what a change a boy undergoes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
after a few months at the institution. I was
told of would-be sailors who were sloppy and
dirty when they entered the school being transformed
into neat, fine physical specimens.</p>

<p>"A hair-cut, a wash, a change of underwear
and other garments makes all the difference in
the world," said one of the instructors. "And
when you add to this lessons in sea-neatness, a
good deal of interesting headwork, manual labour,
good food and plenty of recreation, it's
no wonder that the mill makes a new boy of one
of the seafaring aspirants."</p>

<p>The boys have one great mess-room; and, although
they never have been to sea, they are
taught to treat the school as if it were a war
vessel. They ate with vigour when I saw them,
and I was told that the money given to them by
the Government is spent for extras in the eating
line&mdash;principally candies. Each table constitutes
a mess, and there are prizes for the cleanest
and best-arranged mess; so they arrange their
knives, forks, and spoons in a design calculated
to catch the prize-awarder's eye. And, incidentally,
this idea of giving prizes for the best-kept
mess is followed throughout the service.</p>

<p>Each day is started with prayer on the quarter-deck,
and an impressive ceremony it is. Honour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and glory is what they will tell you they
hope to get out of the Navy, and not money.
And the idea of honour, as it is known in the
Navy, is drummed into them from the moment
they enter the school.</p>

<p>To see these youngsters at any meal is to believe
that it was the first time they had eaten for
a week. They are ravenously hungry, and the
food is of such excellence that it makes a visitor
feel as if he would like to sit down too. There
is little waste here, for I observed that each plate
was polished clean; and, when eating was over,
the boys bounded out for an hour's recreation on
the spacious grounds. On their way many of
them paid a visit to the candy-store, and while
they were playing they munched candy.</p>

<p>The port where this school is located is a
healthful spot, and in war time no person is permitted
to board a ferry to the school without a
special pass. When you first land you are decidedly
struck by the great figure-heads of old
war vessels, which are set up on the "quarter-deck"
and in front of some of the buildings.
There is one of the old Ganges there&mdash;a mammoth
wooden head of a very black negro. The
size of it is startling.</p>

<p>The officers have a charmingly comfortable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
ward-room and mess-room. In the bay is the
second Ganges, now a sort of mother-ship for
mine-sweepers and trawlers, and one of the busiest
places one can imagine. The King not long
ago dined aboard this ship, and is said to have
expressed great interest in the work carried on
from the Ganges.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<h2>VII. "GENTLEMEN, 'THE KING'"</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many traditions to which the Royal
Navy still clings, and there are messes afloat and
ashore where it is manifest that time has not
withered impressive and picturesque features
of the days of the wooden warships. For instance,
no layman can help being struck by the
British naval officers' toast to the King. And
the other toasts are offered with such splendid
solemnity and grace that it makes one wish that
something of the sort could be done at even the
minor affairs where civilians are gathered. Of
course, the Londoner and the man from Manchester
offers his toast at a great banquet, as they
do in New York and other American cities to the
President of the United States. But although
it takes no longer at a naval mess, there is a
something about it which places the civilian in
the shade. With the Navy it is a mess, and not
a dinner where there are many strangers, and
every officer has been doing this since he was a
boy.</p>

<p>John Bull's naval officers are men who admit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the faults of their country. They have travelled,
and have seen a good many other countries and
peoples. From Osborne and Britannia days
sincerity seems to have been inculcated into
them. The discipline is inflexible, but kindly.
The captain of a "Dreadnought" will take pains
to ask a young midshipman to dine with him,
and there exists a wonderful thoughtfulness on
the part of the officers for the men. British
naval officers are lovers of sports, and, having believed
the Germans good sports before August,
1914, they cannot condone attacks on non-belligerents
or the shooting of nurses. His Majesty's
naval officers do great things without talking
about them, and at dinner one of the star
heroes of the war may be in the next chair to you,
but you certainly will not hear it from him.</p>

<p>Opposite me sat a man who had faced death
with Scott on the Polar expedition. It was after
I had left the mess that I learned this from one
of his friends. But at a mess you may hear stories
of men who are absent. It was at dinner
aboard one of the great, grey sea-fighters that we
laughed at the yarn of a young middy, in charge
of one of the cutters off Gallipoli when the
Turks were sending shells like rain. This midshipman
ordered his men to take cover. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
men included bearded fellows twice his size and
age. They obeyed, as they always obey. Then
the youthful fearnought, to show his contempt
for danger, stood on one of the cutter's cross-seats,
pulled out a cigarette-case almost as large
as himself, and puffed rings of smoke skywards.</p>

<p>"I made a jolly fine set of rings that time," he
told one of the men.</p>

<p>Another of this tribe was in Cairo on leave
when he received word that his ship was to
leave sooner than expected. She was in Alexandria.
Not having sufficient money to pay his
train fare, he requisitioned a motor-bicycle and
sped on to Alexandria. From his youthful eyes
there welled tears when he was informed that his
ship was weighing anchor. Nothing daunted,
however, he commandeered a fast motor-boat,
and swept out after the warship, which he
caught on the go. This is the man who in later
years you are apt to meet at the officers' messes&mdash;a
man full of information and wonderfully versatile.
He may have ploughed the seas for many
years, and dwelt in his steel home in the baking
heat of tropical suns, and waited for the enemy
for many a day. Hence conversation never lags
at these dinners. The meals are comparatively
plain in these days; but most of the officers stick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to the delight of a cocktail before dinner, and
after the <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> they have their
glass of port.</p>

<p>Just before the dessert the port is poured into
glistening glasses, and the table is cleared.</p>

<p>"Table cleared, sir," announces the steward to
the president of the mess; and a second later one
hears: "Wine passed, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank God," is the brief grace of the chaplain;
or, if one is not present, the head of the
mess says it. This is followed with a rap on
the table, and from the president of the mess:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Vice, 'The King.'"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, 'The King,'" speaks out the vice-president
of the mess, who is seated at the other
end of the table opposite to the head of the mess.</p>

<p>Conversation, which a second before had been
filling the place, is silenced by the grace, and the
stranger may be somewhat startled by the suddenness
of the proceedings. It is the privilege
of these officers to drink the King's health seated.
This is an old custom, which came about through
the sovereign realising that ships are not the
steadiest places always, and the fact that the
ward-rooms are sometimes not constructed so
that a tall man can always stand erect.</p>

<p>Immediately "Gentlemen, 'The King,'" is uttered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
by the mess's vice-president each officer repeats
in an undertone: "The King." The
glasses after being held aloft come to the table
as one, and the conversation is resumed. Garbed
in their immaculate monkey-jackets, with the
glistening gold braid on the cuffs, the men at
the carefully set and beflowered table make a
scene long to be remembered.</p>

<p>Incidentally, there is a marine officers' mess
at a certain port which naval officers are always
ready to talk about. In that place they are proud
of a wonderful mahogany table which has been
polished for many years until it is now like a
black mirror. The band of this mess is one of
the best in England; and it is the privilege of the
bandmaster to play at concerts and in theatres,
the proceeds being divided among charities, the
bandmaster and his men. Hence the leader of
this band probably had an income of $7,500 a
year.</p>

<p>Here, before the toast to the King is offered,
servants come along each side of the great table
and, at a given word, whisk the tablecloth from
the shiny mahogany. The bandmaster is invited
to have a glass of port by the president of the
mess. The band leader seats himself, and sips
his wine. Follows then the toast to the King.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>At the mess of the largest Royal Naval Air
Station in England they have, by good fortune,
obtained the services of a chef who formerly was
of the Ritz Hotel in London; and especial attention
is given to this mess. No matter how
hard may have been the day's work or how many
men have been forced to leave for other billets,
the dinners there are a sight for the gods. More
than 150 expert seaplane pilots from all over the
world sit down.</p>

<p>It is like a bit of history of olden days to hear:
"Gentlemen, 'The King,'" with its charm and
ceremony.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<h2>VIII. THE ROYAL NAVAL AMBULANCE TRAIN</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Ready</span> to speed to any accessible port on telegraphic
or telephonic orders from the Admiralty
Medical Transport Department are Royal
Naval Ambulance trains. They are always on
the move, picking up wounded or sick officers
and bluejackets at Scotch and English ports,
bearing them to stations where there are great
hospitals, to relieve the coast institutions likely
to receive wounded in the event of a North Sea
Fleet engagement. These grey-painted trains,
with the Red Cross and the "R.N." on each
coach, are the outcome of a great deal of study,
and they are now run with remarkable efficiency.
No millionaire could receive better care when
wounded or ill than do John Bull's naval officers
and seamen.</p>

<p>Sir James Porter, the head of this service,
whose pen sends a train to all parts of England
and Scotland, has a loyal staff, which devotes
remarkable zeal to their share of the work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
They take pride in making a time-record in disembarkation
and entraining of patients. Naval
surgeons at each railroad station watch the work
of the stretcher-bearers to be sure that every cot
has the gentlest possible handling when being
carried from the train to the ambulance which is
to take the patient to the local hospital.</p>

<p>The "stepping" of the stretcher-bearers seems
a trifling thing, but it is surprising to note the
attention given to this point in the first days of
the war. Dr. A. V. Elder, staff surgeon of the
Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and the right
bower of Sir James Porter, practised for weeks
the carrying of patients, getting into cots to ascertain
the most comfortable step for the wounded.
Prizes were even given to the men who carried
a pail of water on a cot and reached a fixed
point with the most liquid in the receptacle. By
this means the best method of "stepping off" was
evolved. There are hundreds of these stretcher-bearers&mdash;volunteers
without compensation&mdash;who
now perform the task so well that it attracts
even the attention of the casual observer. The
cot-bearers are doing their "bit"; they get to the
railroad stations at all times to meet the ambulance
trains, and often have to wait hours and
give up their usual business.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>It may also be interesting to some that in those
August days the Naval Ambulance trains were
not much more than a series of box-cars. The
present cot&mdash;an ingenious arrangement by naval
surgeons&mdash;was used in the naval hospitals and
aboard the warships. But the fixtures on the
train for carrying this cot were far from perfection.
The patient was tossed about by the movement
of the train, and it was realised that in the
event of hundreds of patients being carried
something would have to be discovered to steady
the beds. Dr. Elder invented a clip-spring to be
attached to the cot and the side of the coach. It
held the bed, and had sufficient "give" to make
it steady. In lieu of the box-cars, there are now
coaches of the American type, with windows and
great sliding doors which permit of easy ingress
or egress.</p>

<p>The railroad officials have listened to the bidding
of the Medical Transport Officer of the
Admiralty and have attached some of the best
locomotives to these trains, usually of twelve
coaches. Even when there has not been an action,
and the trains are bearing mostly medical
cases, all passenger and freight traffic gives way
to the ambulance trains. If the surgeon in charge
of the train decides that he has a case which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
should be hastened to a hospital he wires ahead,
so that when he reaches that point the surgeon
or the agent there is on hand with an ambulance
to rush the patient to a local hospital.</p>

<p>Where it is possible, red tape has been eliminated.
The cots in which the patients are carried
are sent with the patient from a hospital or
ship, and the patient is only taken out when he
arrives at the hospital of his destination. For
the cot bearing the patient, the train surgeon receives
in exchange a clean cot. This cot has been
laundered and fumigated, and is kept on the
train so that when only patients are entrained
the surgeon gives a cot for each case taken
aboard. Hence the surgeon always has the same
number of cots on his train, and through this
means paper and pencil work is avoided. The
patient's clothes are packed in a bag, and all
the valuables of one batch of patients are sealed
up in one envelope, which is receipted for by the
surgeon of the hospital to which the patients are
sent.</p>

<p>No patient is transferred from a hospital in a
critical condition if it can be avoided. But sometimes
this is necessary, as it was following the
Jutland Battle. Then the most serious cases were
held in the hospitals; while, where it was possible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
hundreds of cases were despatched to institutions
at other ports.</p>

<p>The route of these ambulance trains may differ
every round trip. One ambulance train may
go to the North of Scotland, while the next one
will only go to Glasgow or Edinburgh if there
is no call further north. The wonderful organisation
not only undertakes to relieve hospitals,
but also to ship the patients to institutions
unlikely to be suddenly burdened with many
cases; and consideration is also given as to where
the patient can receive the best attention, such
as in southern hospitals.</p>

<p>Fleet-Surgeon A. Stanley Nance is the Medical
Transport Officer for Scotland. He is ever
on the alert for what is going on in the hospitals
in his territory. In the event of a great sea conflict,
he receives orders from Sir James Porter
and information concerning all the trains which
are by that time racing to the ports nearest to
the scene of the engagement.</p>

<p>In London, the Medical Transport Officer
can place his finger on a railroad map at any
time and tell within a mile or so where his trains
are. If by any possible chance they are delayed
he receives word from the train surgeons.</p>

<p>Knowing the probability of further engagements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in the North Sea, quite a number of
wealthy private individuals have interested
themselves in the hospitals on the East Coast
from north to south. And these persons take
especial interest in the trains, many of them
making it a point to be at the railroad station
whenever a Royal Naval Ambulance train pulls
in. What with sick men and accidents, the trains
now and again may have a full quota of patients
without there having been a fleet engagement.
In war time no man who is not physically fit is
kept aboard ship, for he may not take up another
man's place without being able to perform
his work.</p>

<p>Exigencies of war have caused the speedy
transformation of buildings in many parts of
England into hospitals. There also are institutions
constructed in temporary form, architecturally
not works of art, but wonderfully useful.
The surgeons at these latter places have wrought
marvels in obtaining good light in the wards and
operating-rooms, and creating a comfortable atmosphere
in the exteriorly dingy places.</p>

<p>The starting-point or headquarters of the ambulance
trains is in the South, and when they
plough their way North they carry no patients.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
The complement of these trains is from forty to
fifty hands, and they all look upon the train as a
ship, and use sailors' terms. It is the "Sick Bay
Express."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<h2>IX. A RUN IN A ROYAL NAVAL AMBULANCE TRAIN</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I obtained</span> permission to make a "voyage" in an
ambulance train.</p>

<p>On a grey, drizzling morning one of the
Royal Naval trains glided into a siding at
Queensferry&mdash;a dozen miles from Edinburgh.
In less than ten minutes six hefty stretcher-bearers
steadily and silently bore the first cot patient
from a waiting ambulance to the war-coloured
train. Cot then followed cot with precision,
only two of the patients being in the open at a
time; and as quickly as mortals could accomplish
it these cots were set swinging in the "eyes"
set for the lanyards.</p>

<p>Being about half-past eight o'clock, nobody
had much to say. The faces of the sick and
wounded bluejackets told you nothing as they
lazily gazed around them while being hoisted
into the hospital train. They looked like men
sewed into white sailcloth sacks. Surgeons, with
two and three gold stripes, between which runs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the red&mdash;blood red, some say&mdash;denoting their
department in the Navy, glanced occasionally at
the patients.</p>

<p>"Carry on, there," then came from the
R.N.V.R. lieutenant in charge of the stretcher-bearers,
when one of the coaches had received its
quota of sick and wounded. Then the sliding
doors of the next coach yawned for its measure
of sick men, who presented an interesting rather
than a pathetic picture, for every bluejacket
wore his cap, looking like a sailor who had gone
to bed with his clothes on. That cap travels with
him like his papers. The bluejacket has many
important things which he conceals in it, and
the most important of all is his package of "gaspers,"
as he terms his particular brand of cigarettes.
The cap is placed firmly on his head, and
occasionally a flannelled arm protruded from
the cot. No moan or groan escaped from these
plucky patients, for the sailor always lives up
to the traditions of the Royal Navy.</p>

<p>From one of the cots there showed a head covered
in bandages with only two small openings
for the patient's eyes. His cap was on his bed.
As this sailor was being hoisted into the train a
deep voice came from the bed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mind yer eye, Bill, or yer'll get yer feet wet."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Bill was a "sitting case." He had come up on
the same ambulance as his pal. He had been in
the same fo'castle and had been hurt in the same
accident. And now they were going aboard the
same train to the same port. Bill paid little heed
at that moment to his chum as he picked his way
through the water and mud. His right arm was
in a sling and the comforting cigarette between
his teeth. Standing on the last rung of the little
ladder before going into the car, I heard him say
to another sailor:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She's over yonder. Bye-bye for the present."</p>

<p>His cap came off as he looked in the direction
of the great deep water where lay the hazy forms
of ships. Others looked, but said nothing about
the sailor doffing his cap to his grey-steel sweetheart
who had weathered the fight against odds.</p>

<p>"That makes 110," said the train surgeon.
"Six, four, seventy-three, twenty-seven&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>The first two numerals denote officers, sitting
and cot cases, and the latter two those of the
men.</p>

<p>"Right-o," quoth the officer of the stretcher-bearers.</p>

<p>Soon the grey train steamed out, with orders
to make a stop for a couple of cot cases in Edinburgh.
In the Waverley Station a few minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
later the train took aboard the patients, and
then sped on south.</p>

<p>Before "she" had been under way very long,
the surgeon in charge and his assistant walked
through the coaches, observing the cases on
board and noting whether any of them needed
any special attention.</p>

<p>At noon the cooks and stewards were hustling,
giving food to men who, I supposed, would only
require toast and beef-tea. But it takes a lot to
make a bluejacket lose his hunger.</p>

<p>"They're all 'Oliver Twists,'" declared the
train surgeon.</p>

<p>Now, there is nothing that a sailor of His
Majesty's Navy likes so much to look at as a
pretty girl. Hence it was not surprising when I
heard a voice from one of the cots, after the train
had stopped at Newcastle, in enthusiastic tones
blurt out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"From 'ere I can see the purtiest gal I ever
laid eyes on."</p>

<p>Business, then, of a movement in every cot.
Eyes were all front, gazing in the direction of a
golden-haired beauty, who blushed a deep pink
when she realised how many pairs of eyes from
the train were focussed on her. Soon horny
hands were being kissed in her direction. Shyly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
she sent a kiss or two back, and then retired to
the shadows.</p>

<p>As I said before, the train is considered a ship.
It is a case of going to "Sick Bay" and of "out
pipes" at nine o'clock. They talk of "darkening
the ship" when the blinds are pulled and the
lights covered. We arrived at Hull when it was
dusk, and at the station was, among other persons,
Lady Nunburnholme, whose husband is
the chief owner of the Wilson Line of steamships,
and who takes a deep interest in the ambulance
trains and the sailors' hospital in her
town. No matter at what hour one of the Royal
Naval trains is due, Lady Nunburnholme is at
the depot, always eager to have a word with the
men, and give them cigarettes and cheer them
up.</p>

<p>By error, that evening a clergyman or naval
chaplain, who had been hurt on a warship, was
put in the coach with the men. The surgeon
made the discovery, and said he would have the
padre moved into the officers' quarters at the
next stop.</p>

<p>"I'm a humbug," said the cheery pastor.
"There's nothing wrong with me. Just go ahead
looking after the men."</p>

<p>Plymouth was to be the next stop. We were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
due there at half-past seven o'clock the following
morning. At midnight the chief surgeon walked
through the train to see that all was well, and he
was attracted by a man coughing. He directed
that something be given to this patient.</p>

<p>"Don't want to have one man keep half a
dozen awake needlessly," said the surgeon.</p>

<p>Then there was an officer who could not go to
sleep. He was a medical case, suffering from
rheumatism. But what kept him awake was the
thought that he might lose his ship. There was
a sailor who had fallen on his vessel, knocked
four of his teeth out, and cut his head. Why he
had to go to "Sick Bay" for such a trifle was beyond
him. In the dark hours of the early morning
one might have seen the faithful surgeon
again going through his train, speaking in whispers
to those who lay awake, asking them if there
was anything they needed and what pain they
had.</p>

<p>"I've got pains all over me, and me 'ead feels
scorchin' with the bangin' that's goin' on inside,"
said one man.</p>

<p>"That's a grumble to get a drink," said the
surgeon, who told the man to try to go to sleep.</p>

<p>Devonshire was the scene of gladsome sunshine
when the train steamed into the station, delivered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
certain patients, and picked up others
for another port. In his anxiety to get a truck
out of the way to permit the stretcher-bearers
uninterrupted passage to the ambulances, a porter
tipped over six and a half dollars' worth of
milk. The patients grinned at this, and the Surgeon-General
on the platform appeared to be
sorry that so much good milk had gone to waste.</p>

<p>The terminus of the train was reached at half-past
seven in the evening. There the coaches
were cleared of all patients and the train split in
two to permit of traffic passing. The train-surgeon,
having delivered the valuables of the patients,
walked with me to the naval barracks,
where for the first time in thirty-six hours he had
a chance to really rest.</p>

<p>"Chin-chin," said he, lifting his glass. "Another
run over, and the Germans have not come
out yet for the real fight."</p>

<h2>X. A TRIP IN A SUBMARINE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> man who craves excitement is apt to get his
fill for a while after a trip in a British submarine
under the North Sea. He may dream of the
experience for many nights afterwards, and the
lip of the conning-tower well seems to get higher
and higher until the water rushes over like an
incipient Niagara&mdash;then he awakens.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing about 30 knots when
I boarded the mother ship of the submarines in
the English East Coast port. It was an unsettled
sort of morning, and just after I had walked
over two narrow planks to the under-sea craft,
aboard which I was to make a cruise under the
North Sea, the sun shot forth a widening streak
of blurred silver like a searchlight on the prancing
green-grey waves. With care, the two-striper
skipper gave his orders to get the submarine
under way, and soon he stuck her nose at
the east. One felt the frost in the air, and fingers
grasping the canvas shield of the conning
tower were benumbed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Three men stood in line on the aft hatch while
the submersible glided through the port waters.
Four other sailors were getting a last good
lungful of fine fresh sea air for'd. At the conning
tower were the commander, his helmsman,
and a young lieutenant&mdash;the boss of the torpedoes.
Now and again another officer popped up
his head through the conning-tower well, and
that opening to the boat's bowels appeared just
about large enough for his broad shoulders. The
nose of the shark-like craft passed through
white-caps as steadily as a ship on a calm ocean.</p>

<p>"Hands for'd, sir," announced the junior lieutenant.</p>

<p>The commander mumbled an answer, and the
men were ordered to close the for'd hatches, and
soon the iron doors were screwed down. The gas
engines shot off black smoke into the curdling
wake of the vessel's twin propellers, and as we
surged along into the uninteresting sea the skipper
sang out to have the aft hatches shut. The
well-disciplined bluejackets instantly obeyed the
order, and the iron slabs banged to, and I knew
that those men were busying themselves in their
particular work of seeing that everything was
ready for submerging.</p>

<p>The commander of the submarine was an agile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
man, about 5 feet 7 inches tall. His face looked
tired, and there were lines about his eyes, which
were only for his ship. I do not think that he
had the chance to give me a look&mdash;a real look&mdash;all
the time I was aboard. There was always
something which needed his attention. I found
that the speed we were making against the wind
closed my eyes, for there is very little protection
on the conning tower of a submarine; and that
alone might have given the commander that
tired look. But I gathered afterwards that the
eyes are strained a good deal in looking for enemy
craft. There, in the distance, was the port
whence we had emerged, and we now were out
on the breast of the sea in war time. Two miles
off our port bow was a grey vessel, to which our
skipper gave his attention for a while. She was
a British destroyer plunging through the water
at 22 knots.</p>

<p>The sun had disappeared behind a bank of
clouds, but there were still streaks of blue in the
sky. The commander shot his gaze aft, to starboard,
port, and before him. Although we were
heading straight out to sea, the skipper was ever
on the alert.</p>

<p>"Motors ready?" asked the commander of the
sub-lieutenant, whose head showed up from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
well after communicating with the engine-room
chief artificer.</p>

<p>"Motors ready, sir," was the answer, and the
younger man wrung his cold hands.</p>

<p>By that time England's coast was a hazy outline.
But on we cut through the waves until
England disappeared, and soon after the real
thrill came&mdash;the thrill of going down under an
angry ocean. The gas engines were stopped, and
the way on the craft was allowed to carry her a
good distance, following the order from the
commander.</p>

<p>That officer looked around, and signalled to a
British destroyer&mdash;another of the warships
ploughing the waters of the North Sea. A sailor
expert signalman used his arms as semaphores,
and an answer soon was received by our skipper.</p>

<p>On the engine-room telegraph of the submarine
is a word that does not figure on the apparatus
of other types of warships: it is "Dive." The
commander told me that we were going down
very soon. I observed that the destroyer had
turned around and was heading out to sea. We
were almost at a stop, when our skipper told me
to get into the conning-tower well and to be
down far enough to give him room. It must be
realised that immediately after the order to submerge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
has been rung in the engine-room the
conning-tower hatch is closed. Hence the commander
and his helmsman have no time to lose
when the submarine is going under, as it takes
forty-five seconds to submerge an under-sea
craft, and at times, if pressed, it can be accomplished
in thirty seconds.</p>

<p>Up to that time I had not devoted much attention
to the inside of the conning-tower hatch,
beyond glancing at the brass ladder. Soon I discovered
that there were two ladders, and that
the distance to the inside deck of the boat was
about twice as great as I had imagined.</p>

<p>After I had taken my foot off the last rung of
the ladder and stepped on the chilled, wet canvas-covered
iron deck, my head was in a whirl
at the sight of the bowels of brass and steel. The
skipper had set the arrow at "Dive," and we
were going down and down&mdash;a motion which is
hardly perceptible to the layman.</p>

<p>The activity below and the intricate mechanism
of the craft caused me to think more of what
the men were doing than of my own sensations.
I wondered how one man could learn it all, for
the skipper must have an intimate knowledge of
all the complicated machinery of his vessel.
There were engines everywhere and little standing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
room&mdash;at least, that is how it appeared on
the first glance, and even afterwards it was clear
that no adipose person could hope to survive
aboard a submarine.</p>

<p>No sooner had the engine-room received the
order to submerge than the captain followed his
helmsman down the conning-tower hatch, and
he lost not a second in getting to the periscope&mdash;the
eye of his vessel. Soon my attention was
arrested by the sight of two men sitting side by
side turning two large wheels. One kept his eye
on a bubble and turned his wheel to control the
hydroplanes to keep the craft level, and the
other man's eyes also watched a bubble in a
level. His share of the work was to keep the vessel
at the depth ordered by the commander.</p>

<p>Although I was deeply interested in everything
that went on under the sea in that craft, my
eyes were continually on the captain, who looked
like a photographer about to take the picture of
a wilful baby. The skipper's face was concealed
behind two black canvas wings of the reflector,
which keep the many electric lights aboard from
interfering with his view through the glass. I
then noticed a door in the stern of the craft&mdash;about
amid-ships&mdash;a door which is closed on the
sight of danger. To me it looked like a reflection,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
but you soon find out that you are looking
at the engines of the submarine. There, four
or five men, ignoring whether they were under
the water or on the surface, were concentrated
on their work. One mistake, and the submarine
and its crew are lost. Hence there is no inattention
to duty. Finally, this door was slammed
to.</p>

<p>The air below is not much different to what it
is when the vessel is on the surface&mdash;or not noticeably
different until the craft has been submerged
for several hours. It is then that the
"bottles" or air tanks are brought into play. I
walked to the bows of the boat, where a giant
torpedo was greased and ready for the shutting
of its compartment. The air-tight tube was then
locked down, and the missile was ready for its
victim. But, as I said, lured as you may be to
gaze at the other parts of the wonderful craft,
you will find that your gaze comes back to the
captain&mdash;always at the periscope, hands on those
brass bars that turn the periscope, and eyes glued
to the reflector.</p>

<p>"Lower periscope!" he orders. And then:
"Raise periscope!" He gives these orders with
clearness; not surprising, as no command must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
be misunderstood when you are 25 or 30 feet under
the water.</p>

<p>"Lower periscope!"</p>

<p>A man in a corner, next to one who has charge
of the gyroscopic compass, turns a handle, and
the greased steel cylinder sinks until the captain,
who had been stretched with toes tipped, now is
on bended knees, his hands extended to stop the
periscope man from taking the "eye" further
down. The captain turns the periscope around,
scanning the waters. At his right, when the skipper
is facing the bows, is another officer, with
his hand on the trigger of what looks like an
upward-pointed pistol of brass and steel. This
officer waits for the command to send off the
torpedo.</p>

<p>"Lower foremost periscope into the well," ordered
the captain. This periscope was not in
use and had not been above the surface. It is
the duplicate "eye," in case the other is out of
order.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the captain, not looking at me,
"she's mostly guts below. Have a look at that
destroyer. We are going to send a practice torpedo
at her, and she will pick it up and return
it when we get back home."</p>

<p>The sleek, lean warship was knifing the waters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
at 22 knots. It was like looking at a picture&mdash;a
moving picture&mdash;and all was beautifully distinct.
Our commander consulted a card, decided
the speed of the warship, and then again
propped his head against the reflector.</p>

<p>"Raise periscope," ordered the two-striper.</p>

<p>For the first time aboard the submarine, there
was something akin to silence, except for the
swishing of engines and the continuous buzz of
other mechanism.</p>

<p>"Light to starboard," voiced the captain.</p>

<p>"Light to starboard," repeated the helmsman
at the compass.</p>

<p>"Tube ready?" asked the commander, his
head hidden between the black flaps of the periscope.</p>

<p>"Tube ready, sir."</p>

<p>The officer at the trigger stood like a starter at
a race, his finger on the tongue that was to release
the torpedo. It was just as it is in the real
moment of moments and a war craft is the target.
The men at the two wheels watched their dials
and their bubbles, and the helmsman had his
nose on the needle. The commander, the gold
braid on his cuffs streaked with oil and rust,
then had but one thought in his mind&mdash;to hit
the target. He looked neither to right nor left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
but was still at the periscope. The warship was
there. We were there, and one could imagine
the tiny periscope just above the water. The
situation was tense, even if the vessel to be fired
at was not an enemy craft.</p>

<p>"Fire!" snapped the captain.</p>

<p>It was no order for men to spring "over the
top," no battle-cry that was heard by the enemy,
but the word under the water that is the order
for the deadly destroyer to be released and speed
on its way to the unsuspecting craft. Practice
torpedo or not, when under the waves of the
North Sea the word works up a dramatic situation
hard to equal. The other officers and men
are interested, and they told me that never does
the word "Fire" fail to stir the soul of everybody
aboard. Though the effect is heightened
by the knowledge that a great vessel is the target
and has been bored in twain, the interest is
still thrilling when the submarine is practising.
With a shot at the enemy there is, of course, the
explosion to dread. If the submarine does not
get away far enough, the explosion of the torpedo
may be the cause of extinguishing all lights
aboard the submarine, and lamps have then to
be used.</p>

<p>There was a tiger-like growl or "g-r-rh" of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
anger as the tube sent out the greased steel complicated
missile, and outside I pictured the white
wake that streaked in the direction of the warship.
It was not visible from the periscope,
which a second after the signal to fire had been
brought down under the surface. The comparative
stillness was gone, and the inside of the
submarine seemed to have awakened from a
doze. There was all bustle and hurry around
me. The captain shot a look at the gyroscopic
compass and gave orders for the motors to go
ahead, and for half an hour the submarine
pushed about under the surface. Then the commander
had the periscope raised, and on the distant
horizon I made out the destroyer&mdash;a tiny
thing even in the glass of the magnifying lens
of the under-sea boat's "eye."</p>

<p>My feet were numbed with cold as I walked
for'd and looked at the empty tube. These torpedoes
cost &pound;500 (two thousand, five hundred
dollars), and in war time they are all set to sink
if they fail to hit the target; set to sink because
they might be used by the enemy or get in our
own way.</p>

<p>The next thrilling moment came when the
commander decided to bring his craft to the
surface.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come to surface and blow external tanks!"
ordered the two-striper. "Open five, six, seven,
eight, to blow!"</p>

<p>The round, white perforated lungs of the submarine
sucked in the air in the craft.</p>

<p>"Open one, two, three, four, to blow," came
from the skipper.</p>

<p>"One, two, three, four, to blow," I heard
repeated.</p>

<p>I felt no perceptible motion of ascending; but
those lungs were working hard, which could be
learned by placing your hand over them. The
captain shot a glance at the dial, which told him
how far up his vessel had gone, and then mounted
the conning-hatch ladder, and soon one observed
a spot of daylight. A sea washed over the
submarine, filling the commander's boots with
water. He was followed by a sailor, who quickly
attached the lowered sailcloth bridge to the
rails of the conning tower. Then the captain's
expert and watchful eye caught bubbles coming
from one of the tanks.</p>

<p>"Close one!" he shouted down the hatch.</p>

<p>"Close one," repeated the sub-lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Two, five, and seven," came from the voice
outside, and so on, until soon all the tanks had
pumped out their water and were filled with air;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and, for the sake of accuracy, each order was
sounded again below.</p>

<p>"Bring her around to north," said the commander.</p>

<p>When we submerged it had been a chilly day,
with a peep of the sun every now and again.
The weather had changed since we left our berth
under the sea. The sky was overcast, and snow
was falling. And this change in the weather
had taken place while the captain had been accomplishing
one of Jules Verne's dreams.</p>

<p>We sped farther out to sea; this time on the
<i>qui vive</i> for enemy craft. But the enemy is careful
not to give the British submarine much of
a chance at his warships, only sneaking out occasionally
under cover of darkness with a couple
of destroyers. Nevertheless, John Bull's diving
boats are ever on the alert; and the man with
whom I went under the North Sea had performed
deeds of daring which never involved
the sinking of a neutral vessel or of endangering
the life of a non-belligerent.</p>

<p>It was the time for luncheon. Luncheon!
You get an idea that the life aboard a submarine
is not all sunshine and white uniforms when you
see the berth for the commander and his chief
officer. They are just a couple of shelves, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
are not used very often at that. It was explained
to me that when you are running a submarine
you do not go in much for sleep. Luncheon consisted
of a cup of coffee and a piece of canned
beef on a stale slice of bread. Tinned food is
about all that can be used aboard a submarine.
It does not take up much room, and it requires
little in the way of cooking utensils. We were
still having our luncheon below when we dived
again, so for the first time in my life I found
myself having a meal under the sea.</p>

<p>It was hours afterwards that we slipped into
the darkened harbour and found the mother
ship, where the officers enjoy some of the real
comforts of life.</p>

<p>"Have a Pandora cocktail?" asked my captain.</p>

<p>We imbibed joyfully. The commander then
changed his clothes, and we sat down to dinner&mdash;a
late dinner, most of the other members of
the mess having finished half an hour before.</p>

<p>And if you ask me about sensations while
under the water, again I must confess that I was
too busy looking and learning to experience
anything but a fear that I might omit something
of importance during the time the captain was
getting ready for his target. Being under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
sea, however, gave me a thrill felt long afterwards,
and I left knowing something of the
hardships that England's sea dogs suffer while
guarding their island kingdom.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<h2>XI. LIFE IN A LIGHTHOUSE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old man led the way to the sturdy stone
structure on top of which were the great horns
which sound the warning in foggy weather to
ships at sea. He was proud of the lighthouse,
of which he was the principal keeper; and just
before he started to explain to me the wonders
of the compressed-air engines, he remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"First, you must know that a lighthouse-keeper's
job is to watch for a fog."</p>

<p>"What's your name?" I asked. He was the
first real lighthouse-keeper I had met.</p>

<p>The lighthouseman looked at me and then at
one of the coast-watchers. He was a slender man
of about sixty years, who, I had been told, was
enjoying the work he had set out to do long, long
before there was a thought of a great war.</p>

<p>"T. G. Cutting," he replied, "the P.K. here."</p>

<p>It was on the western Cornish coast, where, as
in other places in and off English shores, the
lighthouses, war or no war, from sunset to sunrise
cut the darkness with their long beams of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
whiteness and, when necessary, sound the foghorn.
You do not see any young men who are
not in khaki or navy blue, and the old men are
wonders, with their binoculars and telescopes.
Mr. Cutting had been within sound of the sea
ever since he was born. First, he had seen service
on a lighthouse on the rocks, as they say, and
from the rocks he graduated to a land job, and
thence back to the rocks, and again on to the
land. We read stories of the lighthouse-keeper;
but little is written on the modern man of this
species. Mr. Cutting is not accustomed to the
glare of the city's lights, but he knows the glare
of a lighthouse-lantern and all the various wonders
of the work.</p>

<p>Inside the annex to the lighthouse were the
duplicate engines for filling tanks with compressed
air. This air is used for blowing the
foghorns, and when they sound everybody in the
locality knows it.</p>

<p>"Enough air is stored in those tanks," declared
Mr. Cutting, "to keep the foghorns going for
twenty minutes. That gives us time to get the
engines running."</p>

<p>He went into details of the engines, showing
that he knew them by heart, and I could almost
imagine the blurring, deafening sound which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
for seven seconds rent the air through the roar
of winds every minute and a half.</p>

<p>"Fog, as you know, is the dread of every sea
captain," said Mr. Cutting. "Out yonder you see
the 'Three Stone Orr Rocks.' This is a dangerous
bit of scenery in foggy weather. When we
have a fog, two men are on duty; one if it is
clear."</p>

<p>We then went to the lighthouse tower, which
stands nearly 200 feet above high water. To the
right, on entering that building, was a blacksmith's
shop, with an anvil, forge, and various
implements. This forge is occasionally needed
to make repairs, spare parts, and accessories of
the engines of the lighthouse. To the right, in a
corridor, were speaking-tubes.</p>

<p>"Those tubes go to the bedside of every man
employed here," said Mr. Cutting. "We have
only to blow, and in a few minutes he comes up
to the lighthouse. Our houses are over there, in
the same structure as the tower. They are practically
the lower portion of the main building."</p>

<p>He conducted the way up the narrow, winding
stairs. At the head of the first flight I saw a
green-covered book, in which every man on
watch makes his entry of the weather, the velocity
of the wind, and so forth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Many a man's word has been corrected by
that book," said the P.K. "And here's the book
for privileged visitors, for nobody comes here
without the proper credentials."</p>

<p>There were names of famous persons inscribed
in the book, which was kept as neatly and cleanly
as everything else in the place.</p>

<p>"Now we'll go up to the lantern," said the old
man. Old, but lithe, strong, and keen-eyed.
He is particularly fond of this lantern, and was
remarkably lucid in explaining everything concerning
the working of it.</p>

<p>"Does the sea ever come up as high as this?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"We get the spray, and that is all," answered
the P.K. "It's dirty weather when that happens.
But the water usually has spent its force
when it reaches this height."</p>

<p>The exterior windows of the lantern were diamond
shaped and of plate glass. In the middle
of the lantern was the large concentric-ringed
glass of great magnifying power.</p>

<p>"You can turn it round with your little finger,"
said the P.K. "That's because it floats in
a mercury bath. And in turning that you are
moving four tons. When the lantern is lighted,
it shows dark for seven and a half seconds, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
two sets of four flashes, making a complete revolution
every half-minute. They can see the
light at sea on a clear night for nineteen miles.
The light is worked by vaporised oil. The compressed
air drives the oil to the lantern, up
through that burner in a hole hardly big enough
to take a pin point. It is nearly half a million
candle-power. This type of light is considered
even better than electricity. In the old-style oil-lights
they burned five quarts in the same time
that this one consumes a pint with better results."</p>

<p>The actual burner of the lantern is disappointing,
as one expects to see a giant burner. Really,
it is only about twice the size of the average
household one.</p>

<p>Mr. Cutting observed that the light was carefully
timed, and called attention to the half-minute
hand on the clock in the tower. Persons
are always asking the P.K. how he spends his
time, and he wondered why. He believed that
anybody ought to see that there was plenty for
a man to do while he is on a four hours' watch
in the tower. The turning of the light, showing
black outside and then flashing its warnings,
after his many years of experience of such
things, is only taken for granted by this P.K.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"And when I've finished lighting the lamp,
trimming up things a bit," said the P.K., "I sit
down like anybody else. Lots of people seem to
forget that the lighthouse-keeper is not the coast-guard
or the head of the crew of a life-saving
station. They have their work to attend to, but
we watch for fogs night and day. When a man
is stationed at a lighthouse like the Longships,
which is a little distance out on a rock, he may be
a couple of months without being relieved. But
he has others with him, and a good stock of food.
If he wishes to communicate with the land, he
does so by signals; and that's the way men over
there talk with their wives who live in cottages
on shore. The telephone has not been found
feasible, wires breaking all the time; so their
wives have learned to wig-wag to them.</p>

<p>"One night they got a scare on shore; thought
that the men on the Longships were sending up
distress signals. It was bad weather, and every
now and again the coast-watcher saw a green
light on the Longships. And what do you think
that green light was? Just the water running
over the bright light when it flashed! As it
washed the glasses it showed up green."</p>

<p>There were curtains of sailcloth put over the
windows to obscure the sunlight. I asked the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
P.K. about this, and he told me that the great
magnifying lens of the light would burn things
if the sun got on it for long enough. So, much
as they like the sun in Cornwall, they have to
keep it out.</p>

<p>"I shall be on duty to-night from twelve until
four o'clock," observed the P.K. "But I've got
accustomed to the running of the machinery."</p>

<p>So down we went. The last I saw of the P.K.
was when the old Cornishman, emptying cans of
oil into the tank to supply the light which warns
mariners, shouted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Getting pretty fresh now. Hope to see you
again."</p>

<h2>XII. WATCHERS OF THE COAST</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Circling</span> Great Britain are thousands of expert
coast-watchers, whose duty not only is to watch
for ships, wrecks, and smugglers, as in the days
before the war, but also to be on guard for enemy
submarines and suspicious craft. It is the oft-spoken
opinion of many an inland inhabitant
that certain sections of the coast would afford
a base for U-boats. However, these persons have
no conception of the thoroughness with which
John Bull guards his coast-lines. Mile after
mile, shores and rocks are under the eye of alert
navy men and volunteers, the latter being civilians
who have spent their lives by the sea. They
know their business, and even though they are
volunteers, the discipline is rigid. But they are
not the type of men to shirk their duty, for they
would take it as missing a God-given opportunity
if their eyes were closed at the time they
could help their country most. After travelling
around part of the coast-line, a stranger leaves
with the opinion that there is little chance for a
man even to swim ashore under cover of night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>From John o' Groat's to Land's End and all
around Ireland, these coast-watchers&mdash;men over
military age, wiry and strong, with eyes like ferrets&mdash;scan
the rocks and beaches hour after hour,
noting passing vessels, receiving and detailing
information, and always keeping up communication
with the ring and its various centres.
Their little stone huts are on the highest point
in their particular area, and their homes usually
are only a couple of hundred yards distant.
Their chiefs are coast-guards of the old days
called back to their former service in the Royal
Navy. These men rule the volunteers with a
rod of iron. No matter what section of the coast
one may pick, the coast-watcher is ready with
his glasses or telescope. Suspicious acts of any
individuals receive speedy attention, and each
batch of the guards vies with the next for keen
performance of duty.</p>

<p>There is a halo of interest around these men,
tame as their work may appear to them at times.
Take the watchers on the Scilly Isles, for instance.
They are as good as any around Great
Britain. It is second nature for them to watch
the sea. It is a desire with them, something they
would not miss. Their fathers, grandfathers,
and great-grandfathers were watch-dogs on that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
area of the ocean. Go to St. Mary's, and you
will see a coast-watcher, up soon after dawn,
take a stroll along the beach, even when he is
not supposed to be on duty and before he has
tasted his morning tea. The family telescope
is at his eye, as he wants to get a good look at
what the sea has been doing, and what is there.
To the uninitiated, it seems to have the same
paucity of interest as any other shipless stretch of
water; but to this expert it has a story. He
notes the clouds, the sun, the very rocks; and
they say that his gaze is so sharp that it would
spot a champagne-cork floating some distance
away. But be that as it may, there is no enemy
periscope that is going to pass unobserved at a
certain distance by this hawk-eyed, wind-seared
man.</p>

<p>He goes to his cottage for breakfast, and talks
about the sea, then leaves the table, and has
another good look; and it is sadly disappointing
to any of these men to have missed a passing ship.
Prior to the declaration of hostilities, a wreck
was the greatest piece of news to the community;
but now it is the glimpse of fast English warships,
and the anticipation of sighting a German
U-boat, and thus being the cause of the craft's
doom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gun-firing heard at ten minutes past twelve
o'clock to-day," said one man, reading from a
slip he had just made out on the subject.</p>

<p>The man to whom he spoke happened to have
been out of hearing distance, and he could not
believe it until a second man came along with
the same report. It was handed down the line,
over to other shores, and the watchers speculated
as to what had taken place.</p>

<p>Arthur Oddy, who has charge of half a dozen
watchers, told me that his one great regret was
that he had not seen a sign of the war, barring
uniforms. Nevertheless, for more than two and
a half years he has scanned the sea and shore
of his district with dutiful care, and has seen
to it that his men have not been amiss in their
share of the tedious task. His station is very
near the Last House in England, at Land's End&mdash;a
tea place kept by Mrs. E. James.</p>

<p>"What is that out there?" exclaimed a stranger,
suddenly. "Looks like part of a boat."</p>

<p>"That," declared Oddy, "is the Shark's Fin&mdash;a
rock."</p>

<p>True enough, the rock of that name might
have at times been a giant fish or a wrecked submarine.
It was lashed by the foamy waters, disappeared,
and then showed a bit, again was swallowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
up, and seemed to reappear a yard or so
further along from where it first was seen. Finally,
you observed that it was a sharp, dangerous
rock.</p>

<p>A mile or so farther along that coast I encountered
John Thomas Wheeler, the wearer of several
medals, including a gold one received since
the war commenced from the King of Sweden.
In peace time, just before the war, Wheeler did
his bit to save wrecked mariners. He is still
doing it in war time, with his eyes open for
everything. As we stood there, with the sea
lashing the shingly beach and hammering the
rocks, Wheeler, chief officer of that station, recalled
the story of the wreck of the <i>Trifolium</i>,
a Swedish sailing ship.</p>

<p>"It was terrible rough," said Wheeler, "when
through the darkness we saw the green light of
the distress-signals. I shot off a rocket with a
rope to the forepart of the vessel. The men,
who were clinging to the rigging, paid no attention
to it. Then I sent off another rope between
the main and the mizzen masts. First,
they paid no heed to that; but, finally, one man
in oilskins jumped into the sea to catch hold of
part of the rope. He was followed by others.
Perilous though it was on that night, we walked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
out to help the men ashore. One after another,
gasping and unconscious sailors were landed.
Then the ship broke in half, and soon was torn
to bits by the sea. I was looking for more men,
as I had seen one poor chap under the steel mast
when it fell. A wave struck me, and I found
myself caught between two rocks. It looked all
up for me, as I could not move."</p>

<p>Wheeler's awful position was not at first
realised, and his cries for help could not be
heard through the din of the ocean. Finally,
he was struck down by the turbulent sea, and
one of his men, signalling to another, went to
their chief's rescue. Wheeler was unconscious
when he was brought up on the beach. For his
share in the rescue work, besides the King of
Sweden's medal, Wheeler received medals from
the Royal Humane Society and the Board of
Trade.</p>

<p>In that corner of England every one is on
the <i>qui vive</i> for the unexpected. The women
have their telescopes and glasses, and they do
their share, despite the fact that the regular
men of that locality are on duty. Mrs. James's
tea-refreshment place is often the near-by house
to where men are scanning the horizon with
their glasses, noting the flags on vessels, if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
have any in these days, and keeping up a peace-time
look out, for it is a dangerous point in bad
weather. The Last or First House in England,
whichever one wishes to consider it, is covered
with names and initials of persons from all over
the world. Curiously enough, since the war
there have been no wrecks in that theatre, while
in the six months prior to the great conflict there
were two or three.</p>

<p>Local heads of the coast-watchers or guards
have the prerogative of commandeering horses
or automobiles when necessary. If there is a
ship ashore or on the rocks, signal-rockets are
sent up to collect the coast-guards; and it would
seem that a couple of these would wake most of
the persons in that corner of England.</p>

<p>The real business of the coast-guards, and that
to which they devote themselves in peace or war,
is firing rockets over a ship in distress and trying
to land the crew.</p>

<p>It was ten or twelve miles from that point that
I met a chief watcher who had been blown up in
a British battleship, and had thus earned a period
of shore duty. He was "carrying on" for
humanity and country, and only a short time before
he had been the means of rescuing the crew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of a small neutral sailing ship&mdash;a German victim.</p>

<p>We sped on farther north, and every three or
four miles there was the inevitable watcher, who
can telephone, telegraph, and fire rockets when
occasion demands. It is all a modernised coast-guard
system, the men being first ready for ships
in distress, but always on the alert for the enemy.</p>

<h2>XIII. CROSSING THE CHANNEL IN WAR TIME</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the story of a British naval officer's trip
to the Western fighting ground as he told it to
me the day he returned to London:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Four days!' said I to myself. 'Not very
long in which to get a real taste of the World
War on land.' However, the morning after I
had received 'leave' I departed from London
in an automobile and as we sped through the
country there seemed, at first, to be little to remind
us that England was at war&mdash;except, perhaps,
the many busy persons on all farms and
fields. Finally, we came across a mobile air-station
on which were two aeroplanes with folded
wings. It was something which made you think.</p>

<p>"In a South Coast port, however, there was
military activity everywhere. On the waters,
far out from the harbour, which one imagines as
denuded of craft, I saw dozens of ships. There
were large and small tramps, mine-sweepers,
and trawlers, and you were fascinated by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
sight. There was a dread lest one of them might
disappear through a mine or a torpedo any instant.</p>

<p>"Thousands of soldiers were at the dock, waiting
to embark on ships for France. A couple of
thousand of them belonged to the Scotch Labour
Battalion, ready for work with pick and shovel.
Their speech was almost like a foreign language
as they 'Jock'd' and 'Donal'd,' joked and sang,
when they swung aboard the vessel in single
file.</p>

<p>"There was no waving of handkerchiefs and
no shouting good-byes when the black-and-tan
craft was ready to leave. The skipper was on
the bridge. He looked down at an officer ashore,
nodded his head, and the other returned the
nod. Hawsers were instantly slipped, and the
steamer skipped away from the British port on
the minute, and soon met her escort&mdash;destroyers,
out of sight not long since, now ready for
their job. These slender speedsters of the sea
never stop; so everything must be done according
to schedule. Four of the destroyers surrounded
us as we ploughed through the water.</p>

<p>"From the bridge came the order for every
soul aboard to put on a life-belt, and our friends
from Scotland hastened aft to obtain the equipment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
scurrying and bustling about the damp
cabin for the best belts.</p>

<p>"Half-way across the straits we met the opposite
number vessel to ours. She had an escort
of three warships, so that for a flash there
were seven destroyers on the breast of that water.
But it was not for long. A swish, and they
were nearer England and we nearer France,
they getting some of our smoke and we some of
theirs. Steamers go into the French port stern
first, and soon I found myself treading French
soil. Our Scotch labourers were hurried off the
vessel, and they vanished with extraordinary
quickness; and this also reminds me that no
sooner was our steamship safe in the harbour
than the warships nipped off to England, and
all you could see in a few minutes was a wreath
of water and smoke as they raced homewards.</p>

<p>"The skipper of the passenger craft has seen
exciting times. While I stood on the bridge
with him and his first officer, he told me of a
night he won't easily forget. He was running the
<i>Queen</i>, and going over empty, having smuggled
aboard a staff officer who had missed the other
vessel. It was darkening, and the <i>Queen</i> was
about four miles off the British coast when this
skipper saw dark hulls, blanched lines, and flaming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
funnels&mdash;all showing terrific speed. First,
he took the strange craft to be new French destroyers;
but they hailed him in English, and, of
course, for an instant he thought then they were
British warships, when suddenly it dawned on
him. 'By God, they're Germans!' he ejaculated
to the staff officer. 'Nip into the cabin, and get
those clothes off and into an oilskin, fast as you
like.'</p>

<p>"The army man got it done just in time, for
an officer and two men from one of the German
destroyers sprang aboard the <i>Queen</i> after the
enemy warship had bumped the passenger craft.
The German demanded the captain's papers,
and was told that everything had been thrown
overboard.</p>

<p>"The Germans were pale, and the pistol in
the officer's hand shook dangerously. The skipper
declared that the only papers relating to the
<i>Queen</i> were in his cabin.</p>

<p>"'Get those papers, or I'll blow your head
off,' said the German. Below, the captain
moved his hand to his hip pocket to get his keys,
the German started, and put the muzzle of his
revolver close to the Britisher's head. As the
captain was unlocking a drawer, the German
again became suspicious, and warned the skipper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
The Briton told the German to get the
papers himself, and, finally, the useless document
relating to the <i>Queen</i> was taken from the
drawer. It was snatched up and pocketed by
the German officer. Meanwhile, his men had
fixed bombs in vital parts aboard the passenger
craft, and the order was given to abandon ship.</p>

<p>"Just before the bang came and the <i>Queen</i>
sank, the German decided that he wanted to take
the skipper with him. Fortunately, the captain
had been missed in their tremulous excitement.
However, the Germans could not wait, and they
had to go away without the skipper. It was an
experience no man would forget; and the British
of it is that this same man, who had a pretty
good chance of spending many months in a German
prison camp, is still guiding vessels flying
our flag from France to England and England
to France.</p>

<p>"In Boulogne, I had to take a train for Paris.
It was the longest train I ever set eyes on. One
end of it seemed to be in the dock station while
the other was on the outskirts of the town. You
can get an idea of its length when I say that it
had to stop twice at all stations. There was no
attempt at speed until we got within twenty
miles of Paris."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>In a railroad station in Paris this officer encountered
a friend who was a commander in the
Royal Naval Air Service, and the traveller
thereupon decided that nobody could give him
a better idea of the war in the brief time at his
disposal than this man. Hence, after a dash to
the hotel and taking chances of getting his suitcase,
the sea-fighter, with only a tooth-brush and
a piece of soap, finally joined the flying man,
and off they went to the war. My naval friend
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"War stared at us after we had passed through
Chantilly, and on the way to Amiens we sped by
forty or fifty ambulances. It was at the Caf&eacute;
Gobert, in Amiens, that we got out of the automobile
and had luncheon. That town was
thronged with nonchalant women and blue-clad
poilus. Following our refreshment, we continued
our journey. We ran into soldiers and
guns, aeroplanes, and more guns of all calibres;
there must have been two miles of them in one
batch that we passed on the way to Arras, as
well as 'umpty' parks of lorries.</p>

<p>"The first steam engine that I got a chance of
seeing since leaving England was an antiquated
London, Chatham, and Dover locomotive attached
to a long train of cars filled with provisions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and so forth, helped out by Belgian and
French engines. The rail-head, not far from
that particular 'somewhere,' reminded me of
Whiteley's shop in London. Then I observed
a dozen fire-engines painted khaki colour.
There were officers' baths, coal and wood on lorries,
tents, and everything you can think of&mdash;and
a lot you can't. Ammunition dumps were
on our right and left, and the occasional gleam
of a sentry's bayonet let you know that somebody
was on watch.</p>

<p>"As I was the guest of the Royal Naval Air
Service, it was naturally gratifying to come to
the home of that service or section of it; the spot
which had been barren land two days before
was now the scene of great activity. Mess tents
were comfortably fixed up, electric light being
obtained from lorries. There were workshops
on lorries. The Royal Flying Corps also had a
station near by. These ingenious Air Service
men do all their repairing on the spot. If a
lorry gets stuck in the mud they just use enough
lorries until they pull it out.</p>

<p>"Our Rolls-Royce darted into the air on one
stretch of bad road. It bumped out our dynamo,
and we made the rest of the way along the dark
road behind a staff car.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"By that time there was no doubt but that we
were at the war&mdash;passing between two lines of
our heavy artillery on the snow covered ground.
The splashes of fire&mdash;red on the glistening white&mdash;formed
a memorable picture.</p>

<p>"Every now and again, the snow was lighted
up by the star-shells, which hung in the air and
then dropped like a rain of gold on the silver
ground. The thunder of the guns was pleasing,
and as each shell sped on its errand, the unforgettable
scene became more beautiful, with the
glow from the star-shells and the sight of men,
silhouetted in the temporary light against the
white-blanketed earth, going about their duty, as
some of them had done for more than two and a
half years. On we dashed, until we heard a
challenging voice, and discerned a French poilu.</p>

<p>"'Aviation anglaise,' announced my friend.
After satisfying himself, the sentry permitted us
to continue on our way. A little further on, to
our chagrin, we learned that a lorry had broken
down on a bridge, and that if our car could not
pass it, it would mean a detour of nine miles.
However, our excellent chauffeur was equal to
the occasion. After bending the mud-guards,
following the taking of measurements, he drove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the machine over in safety with not half an inch
to spare.</p>

<p>"Guns boomed as they had been booming for
thirty months. This gives you food for thought
at the front. Finally, we came to Dunkirk, and
there enjoyed uninterrupted repose after our
long ride in the biting weather. Next morning
I was up early, and before I had breakfast I
watched a seaplane turning and twisting, riding
first tail downward and then head downward,
dropping a thousand feet, and then righting itself,
and outdoing the looping-the-loop idea.
I ventured commendation for this pilot's exploits.</p>

<p>"'Pretty good youngster,' said the commander.
'Soon be able to give him a journey
he's been longing to have.'</p>

<p>"This <i>youngster</i> certainly seemed to me a past
master in the flying art.</p>

<p>"My interest next was centred on several
barges probing their way through the canal.
They were manned by soldiers in khaki, and
these soldier-sailors belonged to the I.W.T.&mdash;the
Inland Water Transport.</p>

<p>"Later, I had the satisfaction of firing off one
of the big guns at the Huns, and then of going
into an observation post from whence we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
watched shells bursting on the German lines.
The Germans were fairly silent, while we were
putting over quite a lot of stuff. My next shot
at the Boche was with 'Polly,' whose shell spat
forth at her opposite number, known on our
side of the lines as 'Peanought.'</p>

<p>"It was decidedly interesting in the trenches,
almost as near the German lines as we are at any
point. There was the occasional thunder of the
artillery, coupled with the report of a rifle,
which told that the sniper was on the job, and
now and again the 'bang-zizz' of the German
trench mortar projectile&mdash;known better as 'Minnie.'</p>

<p>"At the seaplane station I met a young officer
who two days before had flown over from England
in the early morning and was to dine that
same night with friends in London. His only
worry was that he might possibly miss the boat
to take him back to keep the dinner engagement.
Then there was a young man&mdash;eighteen years
old, to be specific&mdash;who had accounted for thirteen
of the enemy aeroplanes.</p>

<p>"My next experience was aboard a destroyer
which took me to England. I had not worn an
overcoat during my trip, but I was glad of a
duffel coat on that speedy craft."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The commander glanced at his watch, and
observed he had just half an hour in which to get
to King's Cross Station.</p>
